\section*{Abstract}
The ability to monitor changes in the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood of the skin in real time is a key component to personalized patient care. Since hemoglobin has a unique absorption spectrum in the visible light range, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is the most common approach. Although the collection of the diffuse reflectance spectrum with an integrating sphere has several calibration challenges, this collection method is sufficiently user-friendly that it may be worth overcoming the initial difficulty. Once the spectrum is obtained, it is commonly interpreted with a log-inverse-reflectance (LIR) or ``absorbance'' analysis that can only accurately monitor changes in the hemoglobin concentration when there are no changes to the non-hemoglobin chromophore concentrations. This paper addresses the difficulties associated with collection of the diffuse reflectance spectrum with an integrating sphere and proposes a model capable of retrieving relative changes in hemoglobin concentration from the visible light spectrum. The model is capable of accounting for concentration changes in the non-hemoglobin chromophores and is first characterized with theoretical spectra and liquid phantoms. The model is then used in comparison with an LIR analysis on temporal measurements from blanched and reddened human skin.

\section{Introduction}
The knowledge of changes in blood volume in tissue is a valuable asset when monitoring the effects of a wide range of therapeutic interventions, from radiation therapy\cite{Farrell2004,Fitzgerald2008,Russell1994,Wengstrom2004} to skin-flap transplants.\cite{Steele2011} The most common method of monitoring changes in skin perfusion or blanching is by visual inspection.\cite{Wengstrom2004, CTCAE403} While widely accessible, this approach is subjective and is prone to inter- and intra- observer error.\cite{Diffey1991} Monitoring changes in skin perfusion to gauge patient progress would be more reliable if an objective, quantitative approach were available.

Steady-state diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measures the wavelength-dependent intensity of light that has entered and scattered back out from a sample.\cite{Kim2011} Since the amount of reflected light is dependent on the absorption coefficient $\mu_a$, which is itself a function of the individual chromophore concentrations (such as oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, and melanin), it is a good candidate for the task. There are several different approaches and technologies available for obtaining a diffuse reflectance spectrum, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages.

\subsection{Measurement of Diffuse Reflectance Spectra}
Spatially-resolved diffuse reflectance (SRDR) is one of the most common approaches for determining optical properties from reflectance spectra. Typically, fiber optics are placed at increasing radial distances from a source fiber and the measured intensities can be used to determine both the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients.\cite{Kim2011} However, SRDR is rarely used in the clinical setting due to the many difficulties associated with its implementation. SRDR returns most accurate results when there is good coupling between the fiber optics and the measurement surface. Also, the results may be sensitive to local inhomogeneities, such as freckles, hair, and localized vasculature that may alter the individual fiber measurements. Since the signal drops off rapidly with distance, a high quality spectrometer is required to span the required dynamic range and establish the rate of decrease in intensity as a function of radial distance, making it expensive and difficult to calibrate.

An alternative is to use a single fiber-optic source-collector pair geometry. This has many of the same complications as the spatially-resolved approach except it is not as expensive and is much easier to calibrate. It is still error prone if tissue contact is compromised or if there is a local inhomogeneity, but the source/detector geometry can be selected to match a specific range of expected optical properties and minimize the effect of high scattering.

Another measurement technique is an integrating sphere (IS) based system.\cite{Marchesini1991,Zhang2012} In these systems, the total light diffusely reflected by a single integrating sphere from a sample is compared with that collected from a highly reflective calibration plate. Such systems do not have any of the difficulties associated with fiber-based geometries. They are inexpensive, easy to ensure sample coupling, and are insensitive to pathlength considerations and local inhomogeneities since they measure the average reflectance over an area. However, this approach has its own set of challenges that must be addressed before an accurate reflectance spectrum can be obtained. Once they have been overcome, this method is easily implemented and has a low assembly cost.

\subsection{Analysis of a Diffuse Reflectance Spectrum}
The absorption spectrum for a purely absorbing (no scattering) solution can be determined with the Beer-Lambert law by measuring the light transmitted through a sample in a cuvette with a spectrophotometer.\cite{Niemz2007} Since the pathlength is fixed, the transmission measurement is often expressed as the common logarithm of the ratio of the incident intensity to the transmitted intensity, known as the ``absorbance''. This approach has been adopted in tissue optics to analyze a diffuse reflectance spectrum by calculating the common logarithm of the reciprocal (inverse) of the reflectance spectrum (known as “LIR”).\cite{Dawson1980,Feather1989} However, \emph{in vivo}, only the reflected light intensity as opposed to the transmitted light intensity can be measured due to the different geometry. Also, since the tissue is highly scattering, the pathlength is no longer fixed and known. This is accounted for by introducing a pathlength correction factor $l(\lambda)$ into the LIR term. Since this factor is wavelength-dependent and unknown, only changes in chromophore concentrations are possible with this approach. The change in LIR (including the unknown pathlength correction factor) is equated directly to the absorption from the individual chromophores, which is expressed as the products of the concentrations $c_i$, and extinction coefficients $\varepsilon_i(\lambda)$,\cite{Kollias2010}

\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
			\Delta LIR(\lambda)/l(\lambda)  & = \Delta c_{HbO}(\lambda)\varepsilon_{HbO}(\lambda)  + \Delta c_{Hb}(\lambda)\varepsilon_{Hb}(\lambda) + \Delta c_{mel}(\lambda)\varepsilon_{mel}(\lambda) \\
			& + \Delta c_{H_2O}(\lambda)\varepsilon_{H_2O}(\lambda) + \Delta c_{scat}(\lambda)\varepsilon_{scat}(\lambda)
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

It is common to use the LIR values at wavelengths above 650 nm to approximate the contribution from the non-hemoglobin chromophores, and to use the LIR value at 550 nm to approximate the contribution from scatter.\cite{Hajizadeh-Saffar1990} This approach is intended to remove all but the hemoglobin terms and has been shown to successfully approximate changes in skin perfusion, but only in the instance where there are no changes in the non-hemoglobin chromophore concentrations or scattering conditions. Otherwise, the correction method fails and the recovered hemoglobin concentrations are no longer linear with respect to actual changes to the LIR spectrum.

Depending on the duration over which the measurements are performed, it may be reasonable to assume that there are no changes to the melanin and background absorption components or to the reduced scattering coefficient. However, if these values have changed, a robust model should have the ability to account for them. A spectrally-constrained theoretical approach relies on known absorption and scattering coefficient spectra to model the diffuse reflectance spectrum. Since there exists a large body of data on the extinction coefficients for the major constituents of human skin in the visible-to-near-infrared region, this approach may be an ideal solution. In this manuscript, such a model will be applied to total diffuse reflectance spectra obtained with an inexpensive IS-based DRS measurement system. Next, deviations to the model introduced by the use of an IS will be identified and addressed. Finally, the fully-characterized system and model will be used in an in vivo study in which the results will be compared to a common LIR analysis.

\section{Theory}
An appropriate model is required to interpret the total diffuse reflectance spectra obtained from an IS. For a sufficiently large illumination port geometry, the incident light on the skin can be accurately approximated by a broad beam light source perpendicularly incident on a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium. However, for realistic IS sizes, there are a number of factors that introduce deviations from the simple model that will require corrections. While it may be standard procedure to apply all of the corrections to the calculated spectrum, the available information mandates that some of the corrections be applied to the collected spectrum. Therefore, special consideration is required during the development of a fitting algorithm.

\subsection{Forward Model Derivation}
\label{sec:forward_model}
There are several different ways of modelling light transport in tissue. One such approach is the Boltzmann Radiative Transport Equation (RTE), which describes the stochastic behavior of neutral particles such as photons.\cite{Duderstadt1976} When sufficiently far from a boundary within a turbid material, the RTE can be accurately approximated by the steady-state diffusion equation,\cite{Farrell1992}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SSDE}
	\nabla^2\Psi(r) - \frac{\mu_a}{D}\Psi(r) = S(r).
\end{equation}

The light fluence rate $\Psi(r)$, is dependent only on the absorption coefficient $\mu_a$, the reduced scattering coefficient $\mu_s'$, and the source term $S(r)$. The sum of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients is the reduced total interaction coefficient $\mu_t'$. The source term, that represents photons scattered out of the primary beam, is typically approximated by an isotropic spherical harmonic term $-S_0(r)/D$, where $S_0(r)$ decays with depth and $D$ is the diffusion constant,

\begin{equation}
	D = \frac{1}{3\mu_t'}.
\end{equation}

For a normally incident, semi-infinite broad beam light source, Equation~\ref{eq:SSDE} collapses into one dimension,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ss_1d}
	\frac{d^2\Psi(z)}{dz^2} - \mu_{eff}^2\Psi(z) = -\frac{\mu_s'}{D}I_0e^{-\mu_t'z},
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\mu_{eff}^2 \equiv \frac{\mu_a}{D}.
\end{equation}

This equation has a closed form solution that can be determined by considering the boundary conditions.\cite{Farrell1992}

By applying the definition that total diffuse reflectance is the fraction of the incident photon current exiting the tissue surface to the solution to Equation~\ref{eq:ss_1d}, an equation for the wavelength-dependent diffuse reflectance is produced,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff_refl}
	R_d = \frac{\mu_s'}{\left[\mu_t' + \mu_{eff}\right]\left[1 + 2AD\mu_{eff}\right]}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Integrating Sphere Effects on Reflectance Measurements}
When the total diffuse reflectance spectrum is collected with an IS, the finite geometry violates some of the assumptions made in Section~\ref{sec:forward_model} regarding the broad beam geometry. Corrections can be applied to account for these deviations from the theoretical model, thereby restoring some of its accuracy. There are three major violations which must be addressed: (1) the specular reflectance, (2) the single-beam substitution error, and (3) the scattering losses.

Specularly reflected light has not penetrated the tissue of interest and, therefore, carries no information about the tissue optical properties. The amount of light that penetrates the tissue or is specularly reflected depends on the index of refraction of the material and is on the order of four percent for human tissue.\cite{Welch2011} If the specularly reflected light were to be collected in addition to the diffusely reflected light, it could account for a significant portion of the total detected signal (depending on the skin type) which would yield inaccurate results. To reduce the contribution from specularly reflected light, an illumination geometry should be chosen such that none of the specularly reflected light can enter the detection fiber. In this way, only light that has penetrated, and been remitted from, the tissue will be detected. This can also be achieved through the implementation of a baffle; however it is not generally preferred as it disrupts the internal surface of the sphere, leading to substantial non-uniformities in smaller spheres.\cite{Labspherea}

Single-beam substitution error (SBSE) is due to the normalization procedure that converts a single intensity measurement $s_m$, into reflectance by subtracting the background signal $s_{bg}$, and comparing it to the signal from a highly reflective calibration standard $s_{cal}$,\cite{Springsteen1998}

\begin{equation}
	R_m = \frac{s_m - s_{bg}}{s_{cal} - s_{bg}}.
\end{equation}

When the calibration standard is replaced with the sample to be measured, there is a decrease in the total flux within the sphere due to the considerably higher absorption in the sample as well as multiple scattering, which leads to a lower reflectance. Therefore, a correction factor for SBSE would be both sphere and reflection dependent, and can be determined empirically with a set of diffuse reflectance standards.\cite{Labspherec,Glennie2014b}

The final IS effect to be accounted for is the decrease in detected signal due to the finite port size. Near the edge of the detection port, there is an annular region where the light that enters the sample will migrate away from the detection port, resulting in a small decrease in the reflected signal. For the calibration standard, which has a significantly higher scattering coefficient compared with human tissue,\cite{Tseng2008} this region (and the deviation from the model) is small. However, as the reduced scattering coefficient decreases, the pathlength increases and the region and its influence increases. This phenomenon, similar to that investigated by Zhu \emph{et al.},\cite{Zhu2014} can be accounted for with a scattering losses correction factor (SLCF) that is a function of both the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients, and can be determined empirically or with Monte Carlo (MC) methods.

\subsection{The Fitting Algorithm}
\label{sec:fitting_algorithm}
In the absence of any IS effects, the calculated broad beam diffuse reflectance model would simply be fit to the measured reflectance spectrum using the concentrations of absorbers as parameters in a spectrally-constrained least-squares approach. The concentrations of the major chromophores $c_i$, would be the fitting parameters multiplied with their corresponding extinction coefficient spectra $\varepsilon_i(\lambda)$, to produce the absorption coefficient spectrum,

\begin{equation}
\mu_a(\lambda) = \sum_i c_i \times \varepsilon_i(\lambda).
\end{equation}

In the visible light spectrum, the three major chromophores that contribute to the absorption coefficient are oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin, and melanin. Each has a well-established extinction coefficient spectrum as shown in Figure~ 1.\cite{Prahl2001} While both eumelanin (black/brown) and pheomelanin (yellow/red) are found in human skin, eumelanin is the dominant form, therefore its spectrum was selected for use in the fitting algorithm. Additional chromophores such as bilirubin and water do not contribute significantly in this region, however a fourth term can be included to account for the base absorption by all other minor chromophores in the skin layers. The shape of this component is exponential with respect to wavelength, according to the Huang and Jacques data from bloodless rat skin,\cite{Jacques1998}

\begin{equation}
	\mu_{a~base} = a \times \exp \left[\frac{-(\lambda - 154)}{66.2}\right] + b~~\left[mm^{-1}\right]
\end{equation}

where $a$ and $b$ are scaling (fitting) parameters.

\begin{figure}
	\centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/p3-chromophores.png}
	\caption[Major chromophore extinction coefficient spectra]{\label{fig:p3-chromophores}Normalized extinction coefficient spectra for the three major chromophores found in human skin.}
\end{figure}

This baseline absorption spectrum has a similar broad-spectral shape to the melanin extinction coefficient spectrum. Therefore, it will be impossible to separate the contributions from these two concentrations. Since the goal of this study is to monitor changes in hemoglobin concentration, these two absorption components were combined following fitting and considered together as a single background absorption term. The final absorption term consisted of five components with five fitting parameters.

With only a single measurement (that of the total diffuse reflectance), the contributions from absorption and scattering are not separable. Therefore, an assumption of the reduced scatter spectrum is necessary to extract information on the absorption coefficient spectrum. This approach was deemed valid since there is only a small amount of variation in scatter between individuals for a particular tissue type.\cite{Kim2011} The chosen spectrum should closely approximate scatter in both the epidermis and dermis since the skin is being modeled as a homogeneous slab of tissue. Due to the protein structure of these two layers (e.g keratin, collagen fibers), the reduced scattering spectrum for visible light has both Rayleigh and Mie scattering contributions and can be determined as the sum of these two components,\cite{Jacques1998}

\begin{equation}
	\mu_{s~Mie}'(\lambda) = 2 \times 10^4 \lambda^{-1.5}~~[mm^{-1}]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\mu_{s~Rayleigh}'(\lambda) = 2 \times 10^{11}\lambda^{-4}~~[mm^{-1}]
\end{equation}

The resultant absorption and reduced scattering coefficient spectra would then be used to calculate the spectral broad beam reflectance, according to Equation~\ref{eq:diff_refl}. The correct concentrations would be those parameters that minimize the sum-of-squares.

However, as previously stated, the effects of the IS must be accounted for and the model should be adjusted accordingly. Ideally, all corrections would be made to the measured reflectance spectrum to reproduce the broad beam reflectance spectrum being modeled in the calculated spectrum. Since the SLCF is a function of the absorption and scattering coefficients, it was easier to apply the SLCF to the calculated reflectance spectrum where the input optical properties are known.

In addition to the IS effects, the fitting algorithm must account for the spectral resolution of the spectrometer. Depending on the full-width-at-half-max (FWHM) of the spectral response function, it may be necessary to de-convolve the measured reflectance spectrum with the chosen response function. However, since deconvolutions are prone to noise amplification and signal stability issues, they are not preferred.\cite{Kundur1996,Gonzalez2003} Instead, the calculated reflectance spectrum was convolved with the instrument response function and compared with the measured spectrum. A flow chart for the fitting algorithm is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:p3-flowchart}.

\section{Methods \& Materials}
The robustness of the model was tested using reflectance spectra representing a variety of tissue optics situations. Following the characterization of the model, the SBSE correction factor and the SLCF were determined. The SBSE correction factors were established following an accepted empirical approach.\cite{Labspherec} Since there was no established method for accurately assessing and correcting for the scattering losses, one was developed using Monte Carlo simulations and tissue-simulating phantoms. Following a complete characterization of the model, it was used in an in vivo study to extract blood concentrations in human skin from diffuse reflectance spectra obtained with an IS.

The IS-based system used to collect total diffuse reflectance spectra throughout this paper has been described previously.\cite{Glennie2014b} Briefly, the system consists of a tungsten halogen light source coupled via optical fibers to an IS (manufactured in-house) and a computer-based spectrometer. The collection fiber directly illuminates the grating of the spectrometer, acting in place of a slit. The spectral resolution of the system, measured using a mercury-argon calibration source, is 10 nm FWHM. The spectrometer range was 340-997 nm, encompassing 2048 discrete wavelengths. Since the chromophores of interest do not have significant spectral features below 500 nm or above 700 nm, the measurement spectra were analyzed only within this wavelength range. The typical measurement uncertainty did not exceed two percent across this interval for true reflectance values above 20 percent.

\subsection{Characterization of the Model}
In order to investigate the robustness of the model, sample spectra were generated using the forward model described in Section~\ref{sec:forward_model} which were then convolved with the IS system spectral response (represented by a Gaussian function). Two melanin concentrations were selected to yield Type III and Type V representative skin types on the Fitzpatrick scale.\cite{Fitzpatrick1988} For each melanin concentration, three hemoglobin concentrations were chosen, corresponding to blanched, normal, and reddened skin respectively, for a total of six representative baseline diffuse reflectance spectra. When these unmodified spectra were fitted with the model, the hemoglobin concentrations were recovered to within 0.2 percent of the input values. These spectra were then used to determine the effect of noise on the model's performance as well as the impact of an incorrect reduced scattering coefficient spectra or of a change in the background absorption spectrum.

\subsubsection{Testing the Effect of Noise}
To test the effect of noise in the signal on the model performance, Gaussian random noise ranging from one to ten percent was added to each of the six sample spectra. This process was repeated five times for each baseline spectrum in order to perform a statistical analysis on the results. The noisy spectra were then fitted with the model and the hemoglobin concentrations were recovered. The mean and standard deviation of the difference between the recovered concentration and the input concentrations for oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin were determined for each noise level.

\subsubsection{Testing the Effect of an Incorrect Scatter Coefficient Spectrum}
Since the scattering properties of human epidermis and dermis do not vary widely between individuals, the model incorporates a constant average reduced scattering coefficient spectrum. While it is probable that it does not accurately represent the scattering for a given individual, the deviation from this chosen spectrum is expected to be small. To investigate the possible effect of these differences, eight Fitzpatrick Type III reflectance spectra were produced with decreasing and increasing amounts of total hemoglobin concentrations from 25 to 200 percent of a baseline amount (oxygen saturation of 84 percent)\cite{Arimoto2006} and with two percent noise. Each spectrum was fit using a different assumed, reduced scattering coefficient spectrum, from 25 to 200 percent of the original, input reduced scattering spectrum. The differences between the recovered total hemoglobin concentration and the input concentration were calculated.

\subsubsection{Testing the Effect of Changes in Background Absorption}
As mentioned in Section~,\ref{sec:fitting_algorithm} absorption by melanin and the structural components in skin were combined into a single background absorption term. Depending on the timeline over which measurements are taken, it is possible that the contributing absorber concentrations may change. The model is expected to correctly account for this change and to accurately recover the hemoglobin concentrations. To verify this expectation, a set of Fitzpatrick Type III spectra were produced with simultaneously increasing hemoglobin (up to 200 percent) and background absorbers (up to 40 percent). If the increase in background absorption was due solely to the increase in melanin concentration, a 40 percent increase would correspond to a reclassification of a Type III skin type into a Type IV skin type, which is highly improbable but would be visibly noticeable and so represents the upper limit of absorption increase. These spectra were fitted and the hemoglobin concentrations were recovered and compared to the input values.

\subsection{Determination of the Scattering Losses Correction Factor}
The magnitude of the scattering losses is sphere dependent and inversely proportional to the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients, i.e., for a given IS geometry, it will increase as either the absorption or scattering coefficients decrease. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were used to determine the functional form of the SLCF and empirical measurements were used to verify and obtain the exact parameters of the functional form.
A variation of the standard MC simulation called a Mono MC\cite{Kienle1996a} (or “White MC”)\cite{Alerstam2013} was used to economize the computationally expensive simulation. Under this approach, photons were tracked through the material with only scattering properties defined, and the effect of absorption was applied afterward. The MC geometry matched the actual IS measurements, with a sphere wall reflectance coefficient of 0.95. The semi-infinite homogeneous tissue was assigned a refractive index of 1.33 and an anisotropy factor of 0.9.\cite{Wang1995} Simulations were performed for a range of reduced scattering coefficients from 0.50 to 4.00 $mm^{-1}$. For each simulation, a range of absorption coefficients from 0.01 to 10.00 $mm^{-1}$ was applied to obtain simulated reflectance values $R_{sim}$, which represented the reflectance measured with the IS. These values were then combined with reflectance values calculated with the model $R_{calc}$, to achieve SLCFs as follows,

\begin{equation}
	SLCF\left(\mu_a, \mu_s'\right) = \frac{R_{sim}}{R_{calc}}.
\end{equation}

Once the functional form was determined, twenty liquid phantoms were measured with the IS to confirm the fit. These phantoms included different concentrations of commercially available green food coloring and Intralipid\textregistered (Baxter, Toronto, Ontario) such that the absorption ranged from 0.01 to 0.38 $mm^{-1}$ and the reduced scattering coefficient ranged from 0.45 to 3.5 $mm^{-1}$. Both extinction coefficient spectra were determined with a spatially-resolved diffuse reflectance spectrometer while that of the green food coloring was additionally characterized with a UV/Visible Spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 50 Bio, Cary, NC).

The phantoms were measured with the IS system as well as with the spatially-resolved system. The SBSE was applied to the measured reflectance, and the concentrations extracted from the spatially-resolved system were used to calculate the diffuse reflectance with the model which was then convolved with the spectral response function. The ratios of these two sets (representing the SLCF), combined with the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients created a set of triplets which was fitted using the previously obtained function form for the SLCF.

\subsection{\emph{In Vivo} Study}
An \emph{in vivo} experiment was performed to determine the time to maximal vasoconstriction following the injection of epinephrine. Volunteers were made to lay quietly on a bed for ten minutes, during which time five baseline measurements were performed. They were then injected subcutaneously in both upper arms with either 5 cc of 1 percent lidocaine (plain) or 5 cc of 1 percent lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (0.01 mg/mL) (AstraZeneca Canada, Inc., Mississauga, Ontario) in order to induce perfusion or blanching, respectively. Reflectance spectra were obtained with the IS system every minute for 30 minutes and then every two minutes for another 90 minutes. The spectra were processed using the model and the hemoglobin concentration over this period of time were recovered.
