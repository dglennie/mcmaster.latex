			The ability to monitor changes in skin redness through the hemoglobin concentration in skin has the potential to personalize patient care by providing a quantitative objective way of monitoring patient response to interventions such as radiation therapy and plastic surgery. Currently available commercial systems for monitoring skin redness rely on total diffuse reflectance spectroscopy that can only accurately measure hemoglobin changes relative to a baseline measurement when all other skin chromophores, such as melanin, remain constant. This work investigates the application of a spectrally-constrained diffusion theory model for analyzing total diffuse reflectance spectra obtained with an integrating sphere-based system. A low cost integrating sphere-based system was designed, constructed, and characterized to yield accurate total diffuse reflectance spectra. The system was first used with an absorbance-based erythema index to investigate the time to maximal effect of epinephrine – a vasoconstrictor used in plastic surgery. A spectrally-constrained diffusion theory model was developed to improve the interpretation of the reflectance spectra obtained with the integrating sphere-based system. Correction factors necessary to apply the developed model to the obtained spectra were determined through Monte Carlo simulations, and then confirmed with tissue-simulating liquid phantoms. The model was tested for sensitivity and specificity, as well as how it responded to variations in the experimental parameters. The system and model were then used to monitor radiation-induced erythema in head and neck intensity modulated radiation therapy patients. Analysis of the results enabled earlier detection of erythema by 1-19 compared to visual assessment. The work completed in this thesis illustrates a cost-effective, user-friendly diffuse reflectance spectroscopy system which has potential applications in a number of clinical settings.

        I cannot begin without first thanking my incomparable husband, Dr. Gabriel Devenyi. It is not an exaggeration to say that I would not have persevered to the end of this thesis if it weren't for his continual love and support. In addition to acting as a scientific peer during the experimental and analytical processes, his words of reassurance and motivation were exactly what I needed when presented with a difficult problem or frustrating situation.
        
        I would like to express the deepest appreciation to my supervisor, Dr. Tom Farrell, and committee members, Dr. Joe Hayward, Dr. Orest Ostapiak, and Dr. Mike Patterson. Without their guidance and support, this work and my achievements would not have been possible. Although not on my committee, I would be remiss if I did not also thank Dr. Kevin Diamond for his constant presence in the lab and his willingness to help whenever I had questions (and for all of the coffees!). I would also like to thank Dr. Qiyin Fang for the many academic opportunities he helped me earn, including the Mitacs internship at Christie Digital. 
        
        I genuinely believe that, while the focus of graduate school should be on academic achievement, successful individuals develop other aspects of themselves during the process. I would like to thank my fellow members of the Graduate Students Association (GSA) and the Graduate Student Life team in Graduate Studies for providing me with such opportunities throughout my long stint at McMaster. Thank you, again, to my supervisor for giving me an opportunity to teach during my final year of studies.
        
        To my family, friends, and collegues who stood by me and provided support and stress-relief, especially during the final months\dots thank you. I love you, Mom \& Dad. To Dan, Jill, Judi, Nancy, and Rayna: words cannot express.
