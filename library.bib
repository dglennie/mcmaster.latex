abstract = {Quantification of the effect of subcutaneous infiltration of saline with epinephrine and of lidocaine with epinephrine on local cutaneous blood flow was accomplished utilizing the laser Doppler method. A comparison of the onset of vasoconstriction, magnitude of diminished blood flow, and duration of effect was made for several commonly used concentrations of epinephrine. Injected solutions containing epinephrine in concentrations of 1: 200,000 and higher offered good vasoconstrictor effects when both the magnitude and duration of flow reduction were considered. There was a significant (P = 0.0001) difference in flow between epinephrine concentrations of 1:400,000 and all others. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between concentrations of 1:200,000 and 1:100,000 or 1:100,000 and 1:50,000.},

abstract = {A planar imaging approach is described for the in vivo quantitative reconstruction of fluorescent point sources in small animals. The method uses the diffusion approximation as a forward model of light propagation from a point source in a homogeneous tissue to find source depth and strength. The tissue optical properties obtained from video reflectometry measurements were used to compensate for the effects of tissue heterogeneity. The method was evaluated on images of fluorescent sources implanted 2-8.5 mm deep in the thigh and abdomen of rats post mortem. In more than 70\% of the total number of implants the source depth was retrieved with an error of less than 1 mm. The largest absolute error was 1.9 mm. In retrieving source strength, the errors ranged from 0.4\% to 89\% generally increasing with increased source depth.},

abstract = {Applying a fast scanning reflection spectrophotometer and multicomponent spectra analysis, oxygen saturation (SHb) and relative concentration (CHb) of hemoglobin in the skin were determined at eight skin sites in 11 healthy persons. SHb was significantly higher at the tip of the index finger and big toe (90 ± 3.9 and 92 ± 4.2\%, respectively) compared with the forehead, volar forearm, back of hand, abdomen, calf and forefoot where mean values varied between 52 and 67\% (p < 0.001). CHb also was higher at acral sites (big toe: 2.04 ± 0.14 arbitrary units (AU); index finger: 2.13 ± 0.19 AU) than at the other locations (p < 0.0001) where it was between 0.56 ± 0.12 AU (abdomen) and 0.95 ± 0.28 AU (forefoot). In the course of time, rhythmical oscillations of both parameters at a frequency of 3-5/min were seen in 68\% of the measurements, predominantly at the six proximal sites. Heating the measuring site to 44 °C caused a biphasic increase of CHb and SHb which was significant at the proximal sites (p < 0.0001). SHb values came into the range of arterial blood. Temporal and spatial variation of both parameters decreased. Reflection spectrophotometry gives the possibility to directly assess dermal hemoglobin saturation, its physiological variability and reactions to provocation stimuli. Concentration and saturation of hemoglobin in dermal vessels appear definitely different at acral compared with proximal sites.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Two types of skin reflectance instruments are available nowadays for the determination of skin color: a tristumulus colorimeter (Chromameter from Minolta) using the CIE L*a*b* color system and the narrow-band simple reflectance meters (DermaSpectrometer from Cortex and Mexameter from Courage-Khazaka) using the erythema/melanin indices. The purpose of this study was to compare the capabilities of the three instruments (sensitivity, repeatability and correlation) in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Comparative color measurements were carried out first in vitro on standardized color charts and subsequently in vivo on different skin areas in human volunteers. Skin color changes induced by various physico-chemical treatments were also quantitatively evaluated with the three instruments. RESULTS: The in vitro and in vivo repeatabilty as well as the sensitivity of the three instruments are rather good. Erythema and skin blanching could be readily quantified by the increase of the a* parameter and of the erythema indices of the simple reflectance meters. Natural UV tanning and artificial chemical tanning could be measured by the decrease of L* and increase of b* and of the melanin indices. CONCLUSION: The Chromameter and the two narrow-band reflectance instruments were able to characterize skin color and to quantify small skin color changes. Moderate to high significant linear correlations could be established between the CIE L*a*b* color parameters and the erythema/melanin indices.},

abstract = {Diffusion theory is often used to model the transport of light within tissue. It can be used to calculate the light fluence rate in tissue, for example, during photodynamic therapy, or to measure the absorption and scattering properties of tissue. For both of these applications, the influence of the interface between the tissue and the exterior medium on the fluence rate inside the tissue must be known in order to make accurate calculations. We present an experimental investigation of the effect of the refractive index mismatch at the tissue interface on the internal light fluence rate and on the spatially resolved diffuse reflectance as the boundary conditions of the tissue/external medium are changed. The effects of changing the relative refractive index at the boundary are compared to predictions of diffusion theory. The effect of the refractive index mismatch is predicted correctly by diffusion theory.},

We present here a technique for examining human skin, based on the in vivo measurement of diffuse reflectance spectra in the visible and near-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spectra were measured by means of a fiber optic probe, and they were analyzed using an analytical model of light diffusion in the skin. The results of the analysis indicate that it is possible to obtain quantitative information about hemoglobin and melanin content, as well as basic information regarding the scattering properties of the skin.},

The method was used to quantify the development of skin erythema during and after electron beam irradiation of the chest wall following mastectomy. A number of factors were identified which could influence the wide variation in response seen between patients. These were: intra- and inter-observer variation; intra- and inter-patient variation and variation in the actual dose delivered. Statistical analysis, including an analysis of variance of inter- and intra-patient variation, revealed that the major factor that accounts for the observed difference between patients is a true inter-patient variation, with a coefficient of variation, corrected for intra-patient variation, of 43\%. Within the narrow dose range administered in this study, there was no demonstrable dose-effect relationship, raising questions about the role of cell death in the basal layer of the epidermis in the pathogenesis of radiation induced erythema.},

During anti-vascular therapy, the drug Combretastatin A-4 3-O-Phosphate (CA4P, 2.5 mg/200 mul PBS/mouse) significantly decreased tissue blood flow (65\%) and blood oxygenation (38\%) one hour after injection. In the longitudinal study, single-fraction ionizing radiation (12 Gy x 1) induced significant reduction of tissue blood flow (36\%) and blood oxygenation (24\%) 14 days after radiation. The results correlated well with contrast enhanced ultrasound, tumor histology, and a nitroimidazole hypoxia marker (EF5). The research provides further evidence that noninvasive diffuse optical spectroscopies can be useful tools for monitoring cancer therapy in vivo.},

@article{Costin2007,
abstract = {All organisms, from simple invertebrates to complex human beings, exist in different colors and patterns, which arise from the unique distribution of pigments throughout the body. Pigmentation is highly heritable, being regulated by genetic, environmental, and endocrine factors that modulate the amount, type, and distribution of melanins in the skin, hair, and eyes. In addition to its roles in camouflage, heat regulation, and cosmetic variation, melanin protects against UV radiation and thus is an important defense system in human skin against harmful factors. Being the largest organ of the body that is always under the influence of internal and external factors, the skin often reacts to those agents by modifying the constitutive pigmentation pattern. The focus of this review is to provide an updated overview of important physiological and biological factors that increase pigmentation and the mechanisms by which they do so. We consider endocrine factors that induce temporary (e.g., during pregnancy) or permanent (e.g., during aging) changes in skin color, environmental factors (e.g., UV), certain drugs, and chemical compounds, etc. Understanding the mechanisms by which different factors and compounds induce melanogenesis is of great interest pharmaceutically (as therapy for pigmentary diseases) and cosmeceutically (e.g., to design tanning products with potential to reduce skin cancer risk).},

abstract = {We develop a superficial diffusing probe with a 3 mm source-detector separation that can be used in combination with diffuse optical spectroscopic (DOS) methods to noninvasively determine full-spectrum optical properties of superficial in vivo skin in the wavelength range from 650 to 1000 nm. This new probe uses a highly scattering layer to diffuse photons emitted from a collimated light source and relies on a two-layer diffusion model to determine tissue absorption coefficient mu a and reduced scattering coefficient mu's. By employing the probe to measure two-layer phantoms that mimic the optical properties of skin, we demonstrate that the probe has an interrogation depth of 1 to 2 mm. We carry out SSFDPM (steady state frequency-domain photon migration) measurements using this new probe on the volar forearm and palm of 15 subjects, including five subjects of African descent, five Asians, and five Caucasians. The optical properties of in vivo skin determined using the superficial diffusing probe show considerable similarity to published optical properties of carefully prepared ex vivo epidermis+dermis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Colour measurements obtained from digitized images have been proposed as a simple and cost-effective way to evaluate skin colour and the activity of treatments. The main disadvantage of the method is the fact that it is highly dependent on ambient light: even if an accurate control of subjects' illumination is provided, readings remain not comparable among different laboratories. The purpose of this study was to develop a highly reproducible system for computerized colour image analysis of skin erythema, making it possible to compare readings from different environmental light conditions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty-eight Caucasian adult healthy subjects (age range: 18-60 years) of both sexes (14\% males, 86\% females), were enrolled in the study by 49 dermatologists distributed all over Italy. They were recruited among patients who required aesthetic treatments involving skin erythema, like chemical peeling and laser epilation. Once the treatment was administered, clinical evaluations and pictures were taken at the level of treated areas. Visual assessment of erythema was done on the basis of conventional clinical grades (0 = absent; 1 = slight; 2 = moderate; 3 = intense). The clinicians participating in the study were asked to put a standard colour marker (red, green and blue coloured self-adhesive ring) in the photographed skin area. The difference between r, g, b values of photographed colour markers on the skin of single patients participating in the study and the r, g, b values obtained photographing the colour marker in fixed illumination conditions was used to adjust skin colour measurements. Then erythema index (E.I) on digitized images was calculated subtracting red value to green one by averaging procedure of different pixels. RESULTS: Erythema index. average value among the groups divided according to the conventional clinical score increased progressively from score 0-2, while it decreased from score 2 to score 3. The differences in E.I. mean values among the score groups (0 vs. 1, 1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 3) were statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We developed a method for the measurement of skin erythema using digital camera, normalized r, g, b colour co-ordinate system and computerized calculation of E.I. Clinical usefulness of our method for absent, slight and moderate erythema, was demonstrated. For intense erythema lesions we did not find a correspondence between clinical and computerized evaluation, probably due to other factors involved in skin inflammation (e.g. oedema).},

This paper reviews the current status of PDT with an emphasis on the contributions of physics, biophysics and technology, and the challenges remaining in the optimization and adoption of this treatment modality. A theme of the review is the complexity of PDT dosimetry due to the dynamic nature of the three essential components -- light, photosensitizer and oxygen. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the problem and in developing instruments to measure all three, so that optimization of individual PDT treatments is becoming a feasible target. The final section of the review introduces some new frontiers of research including low dose rate (metronomic) PDT, two-photon PDT, activatable PDT molecular beacons and nanoparticle-based PDT.},

abstract = {This research describes a noninvasive, noncontact method used to quantitatively analyze the functional characteristics of tissue. Multispectral images collected at several near-infrared wavelengths are input into a mathematical optical skin model that considers the contributions from different analytes in the epidermis and dermis skin layers. Through a reconstruction algorithm, we can quantify the percent of blood in a given area of tissue and the fraction of that blood that is oxygenated. Imaging normal tissue confirms previously reported values for the percent of blood in tissue and the percent of blood that is oxygenated in tissue and surrounding vasculature, for the normal state and when ischemia is induced. This methodology has been applied to assess vascular Kaposi's sarcoma lesions and the surrounding tissue before and during experimental therapies. The multispectral imaging technique has been combined with laser Doppler imaging to gain additional information. Results indicate that these techniques are able to provide quantitative and functional information about tissue changes during experimental drug therapy and investigate progression of disease before changes are visibly apparent, suggesting a potential for them to be used as complementary imaging techniques to clinical assessment.},

abstract = {Using the method of images, we examine the three boundary conditions commonly applied to the surface of a semi-infinite turbid medium. We find that the image-charge configurations of the partial-current and extrapolated-boundary conditions have the same dipole and quadrupole moments and that the two corresponding solutions to the diffusion equation are approximately equal. In the application of diffusion theory to frequency-domain photon-migration (FDPM) data, these two approaches yield values for the scattering and absorption coefficients that are equal to within 3\%. Moreover, the two boundary conditions can be combined to yield a remarkably simple, accurate, and computationally fast method for extracting values for optical parameters from FDPM data. FDPM data were taken both at the surface and deep inside tissue phantoms, and the difference in data between the two geometries is striking. If one analyzes the surface data without accounting for the boundary, values deduced for the optical coefficients are in error by 50\% or more. As expected, when aluminum foil was placed on the surface of a tissue phantom, phase and modulation data were closer to the results for an infinite-medium geometry. Raising the reflectivity of a tissue surface can, in principle, eliminate the effect of the boundary. However, we find that phase and modulation data are highly sensitive to the reflectivity in the range of 80-100\%, and a minimum value of 98\% is needed to mimic an infinite-medium geometry reliably. We conclude that noninvasive measurements of optically thick tissue require a rigorous treatment of the tissue boundary, and we suggest a unified partial-current--extrapolated boundary approach.},

abstract = {Factors affecting the accuracy of the in vivo measurement of cutaneous pigments and blood oxygenation by reflectance spectrophotometry have been examined. It was found that stray light, the amounts of haemoglobin and melanin, and the level of blood oxygenation all contributed to the measured reflectance and had to be taken into account when calculating quantitative indices of skin pigments. Measurements on isolated sheets of epidermis demonstrated that over 50\% of normally incident radiation is transmitted in a forward direction within 17 degrees of the incident direction and approximately 20\% is backscattered between 90 degrees and 180 degrees out of the sample, approximately 6.0\% of it by specular reflection at the surface. The effective optical pathlength in suspensions of whole red cells was found to be 7\% greater than in simple solutions containing the same concentration of haemoglobin.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) and diffuse optical imaging (DOI) are non-invasive diagnostic techniques that employ near-infrared (NIR) light to quantitatively characterize the optical properties of centimeter-thick, multiple-scattering tissues. Although NIR was first applied to breast diaphanography more than 70 years ago, quantitative optical methods employing time- or frequency-domain 'photon migration' technologies have only recently been used for breast imaging. Because their performance is not limited by mammographic density, optical methods can provide new insight regarding tissue functional changes associated with the appearance, progression, and treatment of breast cancer, particularly for younger women and high-risk subjects who may not benefit from conventional imaging methods. This paper reviews the principles of diffuse optics and describes the development of broadband DOS for quantitatively measuring the optical and physiological properties of thick tissues. Clinical results are shown highlighting the sensitivity of diffuse optics to malignant breast tumors in 12 pre-menopausal subjects ranging in age from 30 to 39 years and a patient undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer. Significant contrast was observed between normal and tumor regions of tissue for deoxy-hemoglobin (p = 0.005), oxy-hemoglobin (p = 0.002), water (p = 0.014), and lipids (p = 0.0003). Tissue hemoglobin saturation was not found to be a reliable parameter for distinguishing between tumor and normal tissues. Optical data were converted into a tissue optical index that decreased 50\% within 1 week in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These results suggest a potential role for diffuse optics as a bedside monitoring tool that could aid the development of new strategies for individualized patient care.},

abstract = {In studies involving the propagation of light in tissues, phantoms consisting of separate scattering and absorbing components are often used. The optical properties of phospholipid emulsions have been studied extensively but the optical properties of particulate absorbers, such as Indian ink, have not been thoroughly investigated. A common and important assumption has been that ink acts as a perfect black-body absorber. The validity of this assumption has been examined. The results presented show that the optical attenuation coefficient of India ink has a significant scattering component, and it cannot be regarded as a pure absorber. The scattering component is due mainly to a small fraction of micron-sized particles. The non-negligible scattering can cause two types of error in optical phantom work if the ink is assumed to be a pure absorber: (i) it may lead to underestimation of the total phantom scattering if the concentration of ink is high in the scattering medium and, more importantly, (ii) it causes an overestimation of the absorption if this is determined, for example, using spectrophotometry or mu t measurement of the ink solution.},

abstract = {Presurgical chemotherapy is widely used in the treatment of locally advanced breast cancer. Monitoring the response to therapy can improve survival and reduce morbidity. We employ a noninvasive, near-infrared method based on diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) to quantitatively monitor tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. DOS was used to monitor tumor response in one patient with locally advanced breast cancer throughout the course of her therapy. Measurements were performed prior to doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide therapy and at several time points over the course of three treatment cycles (68 days). Our results show strong tumor to normal (T/N) tissue contrast in total hemoglobin concentration (T/N=2.4), water fraction (T/N=6.9), tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation, S(t)O(2) (T/N=0.9), and lipid fraction (T/N=0.7) prior to treatment. Over a 10-week period, the peak total hemoglobin and water dropped 56 and 67\%, respectively. Lipid content nearly returned to baseline (T/N =0.9) while S(t)O(2) exceeded pretreatment levels (T/N =1.5). Approximately half of the hemoglobin and water changes occurred within 5 days of treatment (26 and 37\%, respectively). These data suggest that noninvasive, quantitative optical methods that characterize tumor physiology may be useful in assessing and optimizing individual response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the high potential of a web camera to be utilized as a low-cost multichannel fiber-optic spectrometer suitable for either educational or quality-control purposes in small and medium enterprises. The key idea is to arrange N input optical fibers in a line and position an external dispersive element to separate incoming optical beams into their associated spectral components in a two-dimensional (2D) space. With a commercial web camera, each set of the spectral components is imaged through a plastic lens onto the 2D image sensor of the web camera. For the demonstration, a five-channel webcam-based fiber-optic spectrometer is implemented where each channel is calibrated by selected reference light sources. The constructed spectrometer can perform wavelength analysis of the spectral irradiance in the range of 400 to 655 nm. Experimental results also show that peak operating wavelengths of five light-emitting diodes and a laser pointer can be determined with a wavelength measurement error of less than 10.5 nm. The total cost of the webcam-based five-channel fiber-optic spectrometer is only approximately US\$92.50 and effectively performs to the desired results.},

@article{Higgins2007,
abstract = {With increased use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck treatment questions have arisen as to selection of an optimum treatment approach when either superficial sparing or treatment is desired. Other work has pointed out the increased superficial dose resulting from obliquity effects when multiple tangential beams are applied to head and neck treatment, as is the general case in IMRT planning. Helical tomotherapy might be expected to result in even further enhanced superficial dose compared with conventional bilateral field treatment. We have designed a typical right oropharynx target volume in an anthropomorphic head and neck phantom. Three different treatment techniques have been used to optimally treat this target, including bilateral static fields, eight-field IMRT and helical tomotherapy. The phantom was immobilized in a standard treatment position and treated on a Varian 2300cd linear accelerator and on a Hi-Art Helical Tomotherapy unit. 1 mm3 lithium-fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were placed on the surface of the phantom at a number of axial test positions. Film strips (Kodak EDR2) were either wrapped around the surface or sandwiched within the phantom. Measured doses at the surface and as a function of depth are compared with the planning system predictions for each treatment technique. The maximum surface doses on the proximal treatment side, averaged from TLDs and films, were measured to be 69-82\% of the target dose with the bilateral fields yielding the lowest surface doses (69\%), tomotherapy about 2\% more than that (71\%) and IMRT 13\% more (82\%). Anterior to the target volume, doses are always low for bilateral treatment. In this case the minimum anterior surface dose (chin area) was 6\% of the prescription dose from that technique as compared with 26\% and 35\% from the IMRT and tomotherapy methods, respectively. The Eclipse and Tomotherapy planning systems both modelled deep and superficial doses well. Surface doses were better modelled by Eclipse at the test points, while the tomotherapy plans consistently overestimated the measured doses by 10\% or more. Depth dose measurements, extracted from embedded films, indicated the depth of dose build-up to >99\% to be the shallowest for IMRT (2-5 mm) followed by tomotherapy (5-8 mm) and bilateral fields (10-15 mm). The amount of surface dose is clearly technique dependent and should be taken into account in the planning stage.},

The underlying assumption is that the Beer-Lambert law is obeyed, i.e., that a linear relation exists between the absorbance and the concentration of each chromophore and that the total absorbance is the linear superposition of the contributions of each chromophore. In this paper the authors compiled the results from a number of interventions on human skin that result in changes in its appearance and small deviations from the homeostatic state, where the results may be accounted for by a single or multiple chromophores. The validity of the assumptions is found to hold for a limited range of responses. The biological constraints need to be considered in certain cases because as we move away from the homeostatic state, complex biological processes are induced.},

abstract = {We present an initial study on applying genetic algorithms (GA) to retrieve human skin optical properties using visual reflectance spectroscopy (VRS). A three-layered skin model consisting of 13 parameters is first used to simulate skin and, through an analytical model based on optical diffusion theory, we study their independent effects on the reflectance spectra. Based on a preliminary analysis, nine skin parameters are chosen to be fitted by GA. The fitting procedure is applied first on simulated reflectance spectra with added white noise, and then on measured spectra from normal and port wine stain (PWS) human skin. A normalized residue of less than 0.005 is achieved for simulated spectra. In the case of measured spectra from human skin, the normalized residue is less than 0.01. Comparisons between applying GA and manual iteration (MI) fitting show that GA performed much better than the MI fitting method and can easily distinguish melanin concentrations for different skin types. Furthermore, the GA approach can lead to a reasonable understanding of the blood volume fraction and other skin properties, provided that the applicability of the diffusion approximation is satisfied.},

abstract = {The optical absorption and scattering coefficients have been determined for specimens of normal and diseased human breast tissues over the range of wavelengths from 500 to 1100 nm. Total attenuation coefficients were measured for thin slices of tissue cut on a microtome. The diffuse reflectance and transmittance were measured for 1.0 mm thick samples of these tissues, using standard integrating sphere techniques. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to derive the scattering and absorption coefficients, as well as the mean cosine of the scattering angle. The results indicate that scatter exceeds absorption by at least two orders of magnitude. Absorption is most significant at wavelengths below 600 nm. The scattering coefficients lie in the range 30-90 mm-1 at 500 nm, and fall smoothly with increasing wavelength to between 10 and 50 mm-1 at 1100 nm. The scattering coefficient for adipose tissue differs, in that it is invariant with wavelength over this spectral range. For all tissues examined, the scattered light is highly forward peaked, with the mean cosine of the scattering angle in the range 0.945-0.985. Systematic differences between the optical properties of some tissue types are demonstrated.},

abstract = {A Monte Carlo algorithm is applied to simulate the measurements of a sample with glass slides sandwiched between the double integrating sphere (DIS) setup. The effects caused by various parameters, such as the sample port of integrating sphere, thicknesses, and optical properties of the sample, on light losses and optical properties estimated by the inverse adding-doubling method (IAD) have been investigated. The results show that the light loss greatly increases the estimated error of absorption coefficient and slightly affects the estimated scattering coefficient. When the increase of apparent absorption of the sample induced by the light loss is 59\%, the relative error of the scattering coefficient is less than 2\% and that of the absorption coefficient reaches 28\%. Enhancing the sample port diameter or decreasing the thickness of the sample can reduce the error effectively, and the effect of the former is much greater than that of the latter. In addition, the IAD method is proved to be valid for estimating the optical properties of a highly scattering or highly absorbing sample. This study can not only evaluate the error of optical properties estimation, but also provide optimal ways for the design of DIS and a scheme for acquiring accurate optical properties of tissue.},

abstract = {Skin erythema has been widely used as a diagnostic parameter in dermatology. This study describes a methodology for real-time measurement of skin erythema variation induced by negative compression. This study developed an optical measurement probe, which includes a RGB color sensor that translates in the vertical direction, with the magnitude of vertical translation dependening on the amount of skin deformation. Real-time measurement of erythema variation as a function of both negative compression and time was performed in vivo on 10 measurement sites located on the back of each of 12 volunteers who participated in this study. Negative compression was sequentially applied from -30 to -80 kPa and continuously at a constant magnitude (-80 kPa) condition. The results showed that skin erythema was uniformly induced at the measurement sites and linearly increased as a function of both negative compression and time. A wide range of individual variation was noted for skin erythema, which may be due to variations in anisotropic skin properties between volunteers. This study demonstrated the clinical feasibility of a novel optical device for skin erythema measurement. Future studies are needed to investigate the clinical applications of this device.},

abstract = {Intralipid is an intravenous nutrient consisting of an emulsion of phospholipid micelles and water. Because Intralipid is turbid and has no strong absorption bands in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and is readily available and relatively inexpensive, it is often used as a tissue simulating phantom medium in light dosimetry experiments. In order to assist investigators requiring a controllable medium that over a finite range of wavelengths is optically equivalent to tissue, we have compiled previously published values of the optical interaction coefficients of Intralipid, most of which were measured at a wavelength of 633 nm. We have extended the measurements of the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients from 460 to 690 nm and the total attenuation coefficient from 500 to 890 nm. These measurements show that, for stock 10\% Intralipid, the absorption coefficient varies from 0.015 to 0.001 cm-1 between 460 and 690 nm, the reduced scattering coefficient varies from 92 to 50 cm-1 between 460 and 690 nm, the total attenuation coefficient varies from 575 to 150 cm-1 between 500 and 890 nm, and the average cosine of scatter varies from 0.87 to 0.82 between 460 and 690 nm. With these data, we discuss the design of an optically tissue-equivalent phantom consisting of Intralipid and black India ink.},

@incollection{McNulty2011,
abstract = {One of the greatest challenges facing medicine is to treat the patient using real-time data that accu- rately reflect oxygen concentration in the patient’s tissue. Regulation of oxygen and its counterpart, carbon dioxide, is controlled by a large number of physiological control systems that are local, re- gional, and systemic. This key molecule is involved in oxidative metabolism and is an overall indica- tor of physiological well-being. Oxygen is attached to hemoglobin and released into cells, where it diffuses to mitochondria for utilization to pro- duce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that powers all cellular functions. The biomedical value of near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is its ability to record oxygen levels, especially StO2, in a noninvasive manner. In clinical cases, peripheral StO2 values recorded from the forearm and thenar regions are frequently used as surrogates for central oxygen levels. Thus, NIRS holds the promise of being a ma- jor tool in normal and pathological functioning. Applications of this technology are far reaching and range from monitoring patients suffering from septic shock, type 2 diabetes to schizophrenia. Use of NIRS has great promise but suffers from two major types of issues: technical and physiological. There are different types of NIRS devices which de- tect oxygen concentrations using different probing strategies and different algorithms. In addition to the dissimilar NIRS technologies is the fact that the NIRS signal has a number of anatomical, e.g., fat, and physiological barriers, e.g., skin blood flow, before it reaches the muscle/organ vascular bed. Various regions of the body, e.g., thenar versus forearm, have dissimilar cardiovascular responses to physiology and pathophysiological conditions, making interpretation challenging. This chapter presents a brief overview of NIRS technology, its applicability, and promise. 22.1},

abstract = {We present a method to determine chromophore concentrations, blood saturation, and epidermal thickness of human skin from diffuse reflectance spectra. Human skin was approximated as a plane-parallel slab of variable thickness supported by a semi-infinite layer corresponding to the epidermis and dermis, respectively. The absorption coefficient was modeled as a function of melanin content for the epidermis and blood content and oxygen saturation for the dermis. The scattering coefficient and refractive index of each layer were found in the literature. Diffuse reflectance spectra between 490 and 620 nm were generated using Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of melanosome volume fraction, epidermal thickness, blood volume, and oxygen saturation. Then, an inverse method was developed to retrieve these physiologically meaningful parameters from the simulated diffuse reflectance spectra of skin. A previously developed accurate and efficient semiempirical model for diffuse reflectance of two layered media was used instead of time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. All parameters could be estimated with relative root-mean-squared error of less than 5\% for (i) melanosome volume fraction ranging from 1\% to 8\%, (ii) epidermal thickness from 20 to 150 mum, (iii) oxygen saturation from 25\% to 100\%, (iv) blood volume from 1.2\% to 10\%, and (v) tissue scattering coefficient typical of human skin in the visible part of the spectrum. A similar approach could be extended to other two-layer absorbing and scattering systems.},

The experimental setup was a Mueller matrix ellipsometer, by which measurements were performed for scattering angles measured relative to the normal of the Spectralon surface from -90° to 90° sampled at every 2.5° for an illumination wavelength of 532 nm. Previously, the polarization of light scattered from Spectralon white reflectance standards was measured only for four of the elements of the Muller matrix. As in previous investigations, the reflection properties of the Spectralon white reflectance standard was found to be close to those of a Lambertian surface for small scattering and illumination angles. At large scattering and illumination angles, all elements of the Mueller matrix were found to deviate from those of a Lambertian surface. A simple empirical model with only two parameters, was developed, and used to simulate the measured results with fairly good accuracy.},

abstract = {We measured a number of pigmentation and skin response phenotypes in a sample of volunteers (n=397) living in State College, PA. The majority of this sample was composed of four groups based on stated ancestry: African-American, European-American, Hispanic and East Asian. Several measures of melanin concentration (L*, melanin index and adjusted melanin index) were estimated by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and compared. The efficacy of these measures for assessing constitutive pigmentation and melanogenic dose-response was evaluated. Similarly, several measures of erythema (a*, erythema index and adjusted erythema index) were compared and evaluated in their efficacy in measuring erythema and erythemal dose-response. We show a high correspondence among all of the measures for the assessment of constitutive pigmentation and baseline erythema. However, our results demonstrate that evaluating melanogenic dose-response is highly dependent on the summary statistic used: while L* is a valid measure of constitutive pigmentation it is not an effective measure of melanogenic dose-response. Our results also confirm the use of a*, as it is shown to be highly correlated with the adjusted erythema index, a more advanced measure of erythema based on the apparent absorbance. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can be used to quantify the constitutive pigmentation, melanogenic dose-response at 7 d and erythemal dose-response at both 24 h and 7 d postexposure.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A better knowledge of the dynamic biological changes that the skin undergoes in response to ionizing radiation is advisable to improve the management of radiation dermatitis, allowing selection of patients needing treatment or close monitoring.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the evolution of the skin in response to ionizing radiation through the reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) features of acute radiation dermatitis.

METHODS: In this prospective descriptive study, six women (median age, 55 years; range, 45-80 years) diagnosed with breast cancer in stages IA-IB undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy were included in the study through consecutive sampling. Clinical, dermoscopic and RCM evaluation of the skin were performed prior to treatment and on days 1, 15, 30 and 45 after radiotherapy.

RESULTS: While clinical features of radiation dermatitis emerged after 30 days on average, histopathological changes were detectable by RCM after a mean time of 15 days. The main RCM features included initial appearance of spongiosis, exocytosis and inflammatory cells followed by the presence of dendritic-shaped cells, 'streaming-like figures', 'broken geographic papillae', epidermal architectural disarray, effacement of rete ridges, melanophages and, finally, hyperpigmentation of the basal layer.

CONCLUSIONS: RCM may safely detect the dynamic biological changes that the skin undergoes in response to ionizing radiation, even before than clinical onset of acute radiation dermatitis. Therefore, RCM may be useful to make an early and non-invasive diagnosis of radiation dermatitis during radiotherapy, allowing an early selection of patients needing treatment or close monitoring and avoiding skin biopsies.},

abstract = {Human skin, especially the epidermis, contains several major solar ultraviolet-radiation- (UVR-) absorbing endogenous chromophores including DNA, urocanic acid, amino acids, melanins and their precursors and metabolites. The lack of solubility of melanins prevents their absorption spectra being defined by routine techniques. Indirect spectroscopic methods show that their spectral properties depend on the stimulus for melanogenesis. The photochemical consequences of UVR absorption by some epidermal chromophores are relatively well understood whereas we lack a detailed understanding of the consequent photobiological and clinical responses. Skin action spectroscopy is not a reliable way of relating a photobiological outcome to a specific chromophore but is important for UVR hazard assessment. Exogenous chromophores may be administered to the skin in combination with UVR exposure for therapeutic benefit, or as sunscreens for the prevention of sunburn and possibly skin cancer.},

Representatives from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) participated in this process in an effort to improve acute radiation related criteria and to achieve better clarity and consistency among modalities. CTC v. 2.0 replaces the previous NCI CTC and the RTOG Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria and includes more than 260 individual adverse events with more than 100 of these applicable to acute radiation effects. One of the advantages of the revised criteria for radiation oncology is the opportunity to grade acute radiation effects not adequately captured under the previous RTOG system. A pilot study conducted by the RTOG indicated the new criteria are indeed more comprehensive and were preferred by research associates. CTC v. 2.0 represents an improvement in the evaluation and grading of acute toxicity for all modalities.},

This relationship includes three wavelength independent parameters, which can be determined geometry from in vitro measurements for each particular optical optode. The dependence of the optical path length on the absorption and scattering coefficients is also analyzed, and estimations of this parameter for physiological conditions are presented. This study is useful to better understand the scattering phenomena in biological tissue, and to obtain absolute concentration of absorber particles when a homogeneous medium can be assumed.},

abstract = {Radiotherapy generates \v{C}erenkov radiation emission in tissue, and spectral absorption features appearing in the emission spectrum can be used to quantify blood oxygen saturation (StO2) from the known absorptions of hemoglobin. Additionally, the \v{C}erenkov light can be used to excite oxygen-sensitive phosphorescence of probe PtG4, whose emission lifetime directly reports on tissue oxygen partial pressure (pO2). Thus, it is feasible to probe both hemoglobin StO2 and pO2 using external radiation therapy beam to create as an internal light source in tumor tissue. In this study, the sensitivity and spatial origins of these two signals were examined. Emission was detected using a fiber-optic coupled intensifier-gated CCD camera interfaced to a spectrometer. The phosphorescence lifetimes were quantified and compared with StO2 changes previously measured. Monte Carlo simulations of the linear accelerator beam were used together with tracking of the optical signals, to predict the spatial distribution and zone sensitivity within the phantom. As the fiber-to-beam distance (FBD) varied from 0 to 30 mm, i.e. the distance from the fiber tip to the nearest side of the radiotherapy beam, the effective sampling depth for CR emission changed from 4 to 29 mm for the wavelengths in the range of 600-1000 nm. For the secondary emission (phosphorescence) the effective sampling depth was determined to be in the range of 9 to 19 mm. These results indicate that sampling of StO2 and pO2 in tissue should be feasible during radiation therapy, and that the radiation beam and fiber sampling geometry can be set up to acquire signals that originate as deep as a few centimeters in the tissue.},

The reconstruction method is formulated within the general Bayesian inversion framework and is capable of handling both model and measurement errors. Simulations are carried out to illustrate the application of this approach, using a limited number of source-detector combinations.

We employ a noninvasive, handheld laser breast scanner (LBS) based on broadband diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) in conjunction with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) to assess tumor response to presurgical neoadjuvant chemotherapy. DOS and cMRI scans are performed after the first and fourth cycles of a doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide regimen in a patient with invasive ductal carcinoma. DOS measurements are used to quantify bulk tissue optical and physiological parameters, which are mapped to T2- and T1-weighted cMRI images. Initial DOS measurements show high tumor/normal contrast in total hemoglobin concentration (THC, 56+/-7 versus 27+/-4 microM) and water fraction (81.4+/-1\% versus 24+/-3\%) colocalized with regions of strongly enhancing T2-weighted and cMRI signals. After the fourth cycle of chemotherapy, we observe decreases in peak MRI contrast-enhancement values (37.6\%) and apparent lesion volume (21.9 versus 13.7 cm3), which corresponds to physiological changes measured by DOS, including a 20 to 25\% reduction in the spatial extent of the tumor and a 38.7\% drop in mean total hemoglobin content (THC, 41.6 versus 23.4 microM). These data provide in vivo validation of the accuracy of broadband DOS and the sensitivity of optical methods to changes in tumor physiology.},

If untreated, diabetic foot ulcers may become infected and require total or partial amputation of the affected limb. Early identification of tissue at risk of ulcerating could enable proper preventive care, thereby reducing the incidence of foot ulceration. Furthermore, noninvasive assessment of tissue viability around already formed ulcers could inform the diabetes caregiver about the severity of the wound and help assess the need for amputation. This article reviews how hyperspectral imaging between 450 and 700 nm can be used to assess the risk of diabetic foot ulcer development and to predict the likelihood of healing noninvasively. Two methods are described to analyze the in vivo hyperspectral measurements. The first method is based on the modified Beer-Lambert law and produces a map of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in the dermis of the foot. The second is based on a two-layer optical model of skin and can retrieve not only oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations but also epidermal thickness and melanin concentration along with skin scattering properties. It can detect changes in the diabetic foot and help predict and understand ulceration mechanisms.},

abstract = {A theoretical treatment has been developed for the optical properties of a layered structure which absorbs and scatters light. This theory predicts that the logarithm of the inverse of reflectance (LIR) of the surface should be a useful parameter for the examination of that structure. This approach has been applied to a study of skin in vivo. An instrument was constructed for use in clinical situations to measure the LIR spectrum of skin over the visible region of the spectrum (450-760 nm). The contributions to the observed spectra made by pigments and the skin structure were deduced by reference to the theoretical model. Numerical indices were used to quantify the changes in skin haemoglobin content following the application of vasoconstricting preparations. The indices also provided a means of measuring erythema and melanin pigmentation induced in the skin by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The assessments made using this instrument were more reproducible and sensitive than judgments made by eye.},

abstract = {Diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy are popular research techniques for noninvasive disease diagnostics. Most systems include an optical fiber probe that transmits and collects optical spectra in contact with the suspected lesion. The purpose of this study is to investigate probe pressure effects on human skin spectroscopic measurements. We conduct an in-vivo experiment on human skin tissue to study the short-term (<2 s) and long-term (>30 s) effects of probe pressure on diffuse reflectance and fluorescence measurements. Short-term light probe pressure (P0<9 mN∕mm2) effects are within 0 ± 10\% on all physiological properties extracted from diffuse reflectance and fluorescence measurements, and less than 0±5\% for diagnostically significant physiological properties. Absorption decreases with site-specific variations due to blood being compressed out of the sampled volume. Reduced scattering coefficient variation is site specific. Intrinsic fluorescence shows a large standard error, although no specific pressure-related trend is observed. Differences in tissue structure and morphology contribute to site-specific probe pressure effects. Therefore, the effects of pressure can be minimized when the pressure is small and applied for a short amount of time; however, long-term and large pressures induce significant distortions in measured spectra.},

@article{Anderson1981,
abstract = {An integrated review of the transfer of optical radiation into human skin is presented, aimed at developing useful models for photomedicine. The component chromophores of epidermis and stratum corneum in general determine the attenuation of radiation in these layers, moreso than does optical scattering. Epidermal thickness and melanization are important factors for UV wavelengths less than 300 nm, whereas the attenuation of UVA (320-400 nm) and visible radiation is primarily via melanin. The selective penetration of all optical wavelengths into psoriatic skin can be maximized by application of clear lipophilic liquids, which decrease regular reflectance by a refractive-index matching mechanism. Sensitivity to wavelengths less than 320 nm can be enhanced by prolonged aqueous bathing, which extracts urocanic acid and other diffusible epidermal chromophores. Optical properties of the dermis are modelled using the Kubelka-Munk approach, and calculations of scattering and absorption coefficients are presented. This simple approach allows estimates of the penetration of radiation in vivo using noninvasive measurements of cutaneous spectral remittance (diffuse reflectance). Although the blood chromophores Hb, HbO2, and bilirubin determine dermal absorption of wavelengths longer than 320 nm, scattering by collagen fibers largely determines the depths to which these wavelengths penetrate the dermis, and profoundly modifies skin colors. An optical "window" exists between 600 and 1300 nm, which offers the possibility of treating large tissue volumes with certain long-wavelength photosensitizers. Moreover, whenever photosensitized action spectra extend across the near UV and/or visible spectrum, judicious choice of wavelengths allows some selection of the tissue layers directly affected.},

@article{Wrixon2008,
abstract = {This paper provides a review of the 2007 recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These new recommendations take account of the latest biological and physical information and consolidate the additional guidance provided by ICRP since 1990. The changes to the scientific data are not substantial. ICRP has retained its fundamental hypothesis for the induction of stochastic effects of linearity of dose and effect without threshold and a dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF) of 2 to derive nominal risk coefficients for low doses and low dose rates. While the overall detriment from low radiation doses has remained unchanged, ICRP has made adjustments to the values of the radiation and tissue weighting factors. In particular, the tissue weighting factor for breast has increased while that for gonads has decreased. There are some presentational changes to the system of protection. While ICRP has maintained the three fundamental principles--justification, optimisation of protection, and dose limitation-it has attempted to develop a more holistic approach to radiological protection covering all exposure situations--planned, existing and emergency--and all radiation sources, whether of natural or artificial origin. This approach should ensure that attention is focused on those exposures that can reasonably be controlled. It has also strengthened the principle of optimisation of protection with a particular emphasis on the use of constraints for planned exposure situations and reference levels for existing and emergency exposure situations. Dose constraints and reference levels are categorised into three bands which should assist in rationalising the many values of dose restrictions given in earlier ICRP publications. There are no changes to the dose limits. ICRP also indicates its intentions with respect to the development of further guidance on the protection of the environment. The fact that these new recommendations are more a matter of consolidation of previous ICRP recommendations and guidance should provide confidence that the system of protection established by and large in its present form several decades ago has reached a certain level of maturity. As such, no major changes to radiological protection regulations based on the 1990 recommendations should be necessary.},

The study's purpose is to determine whether skin discoloration correlates with the development of fibrosis in breast-cancer radiotherapy. METHODS : Eighteen breast-cancer patients were enrolled in our initial study. All patients were previously treated with a standard course of radiation, and the median follow-up time was 22 months. The treated and untreated breasts were scanned with a spectrophotometer and an ultrasound. Two spectrophotometer parameters-melanin and erythema indices-were used to quantitatively assess skin discoloration. Two ultrasound parameters-skin thickness and Pearson coefficient of the hypodermis-were used to quantitatively assess severity of fibrosis. These measurements were correlated with clinical assessments (RTOG late morbidity scores).},

abstract = {Diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) and imaging are emerging diagnostic techniques that quantitatively measure the concentration of deoxy-hemoglobin (ctHHb), oxy-hemoglobin (ctO(2)Hb), water (ctH(2)O), and lipid in cm-thick tissues. In early-stage clinical studies, diffuse optical imaging and DOS have been used to characterize breast tumor biochemical composition and monitor therapeutic response in stage II/III neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients. We investigated whether DOS measurements obtained before and 1 week into a 3-month adriamycin/cytoxan neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen can predict final, postsurgical pathological response. Baseline DOS measurements of 11 patients before therapy revealed significant increases in tumor ctHHb, ctO(2)Hb, ctH(2)O, and spectral scattering slope, and decreases in bulk lipids, relative to normal breast tissue. Tumor concentrations of ctHHb, ctO(2)Hb, and ctH(2)O dropped 27 +/- 15\%, 33 +/- 7\%, and 11 +/- 15\%, respectively, within 1 week (6.5 +/- 1.4 days) of the first treatment for pathology-confirmed responders (n = 6), whereas nonresponders (n = 5) and normal side controls showed no significant changes in these parameters. The best single predictor of therapeutic response 1 week posttreatment was ctHHb (83\% sensitivity, 100\% specificity), while discrimination analysis based on combined ctHHb and ctH(2)O changes classified responders vs. nonresponders with 100\% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the pretreatment tumor-to-normal ctO(2)Hb ratio was significantly higher in responders (2.82 +/- 0.44) vs. nonresponders (1.82 +/- 0.49). These results highlight DOS sensitivity to tumor cellular metabolism and biochemical composition and demonstrate its potential for predicting and monitoring an individual's response to treatment.},

abstract = {In order to visualize human skin hemodynamics, we investigated a method that is specifically developed for the visualization of concentrations of oxygenated blood, deoxygenated blood, and melanin in skin tissue from digital RGB color images. Images of total blood concentration and oxygen saturation can also be reconstructed from the results of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Experiments using tissue-like agar gel phantoms demonstrated the ability of the developed method to quantitatively visualize the transition from an oxygenated blood to a deoxygenated blood in dermis. In vivo imaging of the chromophore concentrations and tissue oxygen saturation in the skin of the human hand are performed for 14 subjects during upper limb occlusion at 50 and 250 mm Hg. The response of the total blood concentration in the skin acquired by this method and forearm volume changes obtained from the conventional strain-gauge plethysmograph were comparable during the upper arm occlusion at pressures of both 50 and 250 mm Hg. The results presented in the present paper indicate the possibility of visualizing the hemodynamics of subsurface skin tissue.},

abstract = {A number of noninvasive approaches have been developed over the years to provide objective evaluation of the skin both in health and in disease. The advent of computers, as well as of lasers and photonics, has made it possible to develop additional techniques that were impossible a few years ago. These approaches provide the dermatologist with sensitive tools to measure the skin's condition in terms of physiologic parameters (e.g., color, erythema and pigmentation, induration, sebaceous and stratum corneum lipids, barrier function, etc.). Yet, a typical dermatologic diagnosis relies primarily on the trained eyes of the physician and to a lesser extent on information from other senses, such as touch and smell. The trained senses of the dermatologist backed by his/her brain form a powerful set of tools for evaluating the skin. The golden rule in diagnosis remains the histologic examination of a skin biopsy, a rather invasive method. These tools have served the profession well. The advent of ever faster and cheaper computers and of sensitive, inexpensive optical instrumentation of minimal dimensions provides the professional with the possibility of making objective measures of a number of skin parameters.},

A Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System in conjunction with data preprocessing techniques is employed to perform multivariate calibration and prediction on reflectance data generated by Monte Carlo simulations. The preprocessing consists of either a principal component analysis or a new, extended curve-fitting procedure originating from diffusion theory. Prediction tests on reflectance data with absorption coefficients between 0.04 and 0.06 mm(-1) and reduced scattering coefficients between 0.45 and 0.99 mm(-1) show the root-mean-square error of this method to be 0.25\% for both coefficients. With reference to practical applications, we also describe how the prediction accuracy is affected by using relative instead of absolute reflectance data, by imposing measurement noise on the reflectance data, and by changing the number and the position of detectors.},

We considered the contribution of the collagen to the absorption spectrum of in vivo normal skin and keloids of 12 subjects derived from our diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) system in the wavelength range from 550 to 860 nm. It was found that the collagen concentration, the hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and the reduced scattering coefficient of keloids were remarkably different from that of normal skin. Our results suggest that our DRS system could assist clinicians in understanding the functional and structural condition of keloid scars. In the future, we will evaluate the accuracy of our system in the keloid diagnosis and investigate the applicability of our system for other skin-collagen-related studies.},

abstract = {Applying a fast scanning reflection spectrophotometer and multicomponent spectra analysis, oxygen saturation (SHb) and relative concentration (CHb) of hemoglobin in the skin were determined at eight skin sites in 11 healthy persons. SHb was significantly higher at the tip of the index finger and big toe (90 ± 3.9 and 92 ± 4.2\%, respectively) compared with the forehead, volar forearm, back of hand, abdomen, calf and forefoot where mean values varied between 52 and 67\% (p < 0.001). CHb also was higher at acral sites (big toe: 2.04 ± 0.14 arbitrary units (AU); index finger: 2.13 ± 0.19 AU) than at the other locations (p < 0.0001) where it was between 0.56 ± 0.12 AU (abdomen) and 0.95 ± 0.28 AU (forefoot). In the course of time, rhythmical oscillations of both parameters at a frequency of 3-5/min were seen in 68\% of the measurements, predominantly at the six proximal sites. Heating the measuring site to 44 °C caused a biphasic increase of CHb and SHb which was significant at the proximal sites (p < 0.0001). SHb values came into the range of arterial blood. Temporal and spatial variation of both parameters decreased. Reflection spectrophotometry gives the possibility to directly assess dermal hemoglobin saturation, its physiological variability and reactions to provocation stimuli. Concentration and saturation of hemoglobin in dermal vessels appear definitely different at acral compared with proximal sites.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of UV radiation at extreme altitude and to assess the effect it has on the skin.

METHODS: Fifteen expeditioners and 10 Sherpas were assessed during a climbing expedition on the north side of Mt Everest (8848 m). UV exposure measurement and diffuse skin reflectance spectrophotometry were performed at the beginning and end of the expedition.

RESULTS: Over the course of the expedition, the expeditioners and Sherpas received a median dose of 93.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 61.0-102.8) and 102.5 (IQR, 72.2-117.8) minimal erythemal doses (MEDs) of UV radiation. The maximum dosage exceeded 106 ± 1.4 MEDs. Using reflectance spectrophotometry, expeditioner and Sherpa melanin-hemoglobin increased by 83.6\% (IQR, -1.5 to 89.8\%) and 24.7\% (IQR, -22.4 to 61.5\%) for exposed skin, respectively. The amount of subcutaneous lipid-water decreased by a factor of 196.6 (IQR, 52.1-308.4) and 46.7 (IQR, 1.8-1156.5), for expeditioners and Sherpas, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: This expedition's participants received massive doses of UV radiation during their time at high altitude. In many individuals this was similar to the annual exposure of northern European office-workers (100 MEDs). Diffuse skin reflectance spectroscopy revealed considerable subcutaneous lipid loss, skin dehydration, and increased melanin in keeping with these levels of exposure.},

abstract = {We propose a new technique that combines two-dimensional (2D) multispectral imaging and polarization gating for observing the blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) level in human skin tissue. The spectral decomposition of the skin tissue image provides the principal information on blood oxygenation. The polarization gating selects the measurement depth according to the relative orientation of the two polarizers that are placed on a camera and a light source. The combination of these two methods yields multispectral images of the superficial and deep layers of the skin tissue separately. In order to evaluate the blood oxygen, we focus on the multispectral images of the deep site. The SpO2 levels at each image pixel are calculated by means of the partial least squares regression with respect to each reflectance spectrum. The reassignment of the predicted responses retrieves an image whose pixel values represent the relative SpO2 levels. A demonstration experiment for acquiring the multispectral polarization images is performed in the spectral range of 500 to 680 nm, and the SpO2 distributions are obtained.},

MI utilizes principles of frequency-domain sampling and model-based analysis of the spatial modulation transfer function (s-MTF). We present and compare analytic diffusion and probabilistic Monte Carlo models of diffuse reflectance in the spatial frequency domain. Next, we perform MI measurements on tissue-simulating phantoms exhibiting a wide range of l values (0.5 mm to 3 mm) and (micro(s) (')micro(a)) ratios (8 to 500), reporting an overall accuracy of approximately 6\% and 3\% in absorption and reduced scattering parameters, respectively. Sampling of only two spatial frequencies, achieved with only three camera images, is found to be sufficient for accurate determination of the optical properties. We then perform MI measurements in an in vivo tissue system, demonstrating spatial mapping of the absorption and scattering optical contrast in a human forearm and dynamic measurements of a forearm during venous occlusion. Last, metrics of spatial resolution are assessed through both simulations and measurements of spatially heterogeneous phantoms.},

abstract = {We describe a novel reconstruction algorithm based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to multi-spectral imaging data. Using numerical phantoms, based on a two layered skin model developed previously, we found analytical expressions, which convert qualitative PCA results into quantitative blood volume and oxygenation values, assuming the epidermal thickness to be known. We also evaluate the limits of accuracy of this method when the value of the epidermal thickness is not known. We show that blood volume can reliably be extracted (less than 6\% error) even if the assumed thickness deviates 0.04mm from the actual value, whereas the error in blood oxygenation can be as large as 25\% for the same deviation in thickness. This PCA based reconstruction was found to extract blood volume and blood oxygenation with less than 8\% error, if the underlying structure is known. We then apply the method to in vivo multi-spectral images from a healthy volunteer's lower forearm, complemented by images of the same area using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for measuring the epidermal thickness. Reconstruction of the imaging results using a two layered analytical skin model was compared to PCA based reconstruction results. A point wise correlation was found, showing the proof of principle of using PCA based reconstruction for blood volume and oxygenation extraction.},

@article{Zharov2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Imaging of subcutaneous veins is important in many applications, such as gaining venous access and vascular surgery. Despite a long history of medical infrared (IR) photography and imaging, this technique is not widely used for this purpose. Here we revisited and explored the capability of near-IR imaging to visualize subcutaneous structures, with a focus on diagnostics of superficial veins.

STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: An IR device comprising a head-mounted IR LED array (880 nm), a small conventional CCD camera (Toshiba Ik-mui, Tokyo, Japan), virtual-reality optics, polarizers, filters, and diffusers was used in vivo to obtain images of different subcutaneous structures. The same device was used to estimate the IR image quality as a function of wavelength produced by a tunable xenon lamp-based monochrometer in the range of 500-1,000 nm and continuous-wave Nd:YAG (1.06 microm) and diode (805 nm) lasers.

RESULTS: The various modes of optical illumination were compared in vivo. Contrast of the IR images in the reflectance mode was measured in the near-IR spectral range of 650-1,060 nm. Using the LED array, various IR images were obtained in vivo, including images of vein structure in a pigmented, fatty forearm, varicose leg veins, and vascular lesions of the tongue.

CONCLUSION: Imaging in the near-IR range (880-930 nm) provides relatively good contrast of subcutaneous veins, underscoring its value for diagnosis. This technique has the potential for the diagnosis of varicose veins with a diameter of 0.5-2 mm at a depth of 1-3 mm, guidance of venous access, podiatry, phlebotomy, injection sclerotherapy, and control of laser interstitial therapy.},

Transcutaneous oxygenation varied between subjects in both treated and non-treated breast. Subjects without diabetes mellitus (n=16) had an average oxygenation level of 64.8 ± 19.9mmHg in the irradiated breast and an average of 72.3 ± 18.1mmHg (p=0.018) at the corresponding location in the control breast. Patients with diabetes (n=4) showed a different oxygenation pattern, with lower oxygenation levels in control tissue and no decrease in the irradiated breast.

A stochastic Monte Carlo method is used to convert the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient and wavelength-independent scattering coefficient into reflected intensity. The absorption properties of skin tissues in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions are estimated by taking into account the spatial distribution of blood vessels, water and melanin content within distinct anatomical layers. The geometrical peculiarities of skin histological structure, degree of blood oxygenation and the haematocrit index are also taken into account. We demonstrate that when the model is supplied with reasonable physical and structural parameters of skin, the results of the simulation agree reasonably well with the results of in vivo measurements of skin spectra.},

Studies were done with solar-simulated radiation (SSR), UVB, and UVAI and we determined the just perceptible minimal erythema dose (MED) and, in some cases, quantified erythema with a reflectance device. The results show that there is a trend for increased SSR MED with skin type, with the MED of skin type IV being approximately twice that of skin type I, a smaller difference than one might have expected. However, there is a very considerable overlap of MED between skin types which shows that MED is a very poor indictor of skin type. Quantitative dose-response and time course studies with SSR and UVAI showed broadly similar responses when comparable MED-based exposures were given. We used our data to test the new concept of the standard erythema dose (SED) with two different erythema action spectra, and confirmed that the SED approach works with the different UVR sources that we studied.},

The optical properties, absorption coefficient (µ(a)) and reduced scattering coefficient (µ(s)'), are independently varied using liquid phantoms and measured concurrently with the flow index using a hybrid optical system combining a dual-wavelength DCS flow device with a commercial frequency-domain tissue-oximeter. DCS flow indices are calculated at two wavelengths (785 and 830 nm) using measured µ(a) and µ(s)' or assumed constant µ(a) and µ(s)'. Inaccurate µ(s)' assumptions resulted in much greater flow index errors than inaccurate µ(a). Underestimated/overestimated µ(s)' from -35\%/+175\% lead to flow index errors of +110\%/-80\%, whereas underestimated/overestimated µ(a) from -40\%/+150\% lead to -20\%/+40\%, regardless of the wavelengths used. Examination of a clinical study involving human head and neck tumors indicates up to +280\% flow index errors resulted from inter-patient optical property variations. These findings suggest that studies involving significant µ(a) and µ(s)' changes should concurrently measure flow index and optical properties for accurate extraction of blood flow information.},

abstract = {Quantitative dosimetry in the treatment of skin disorders with (laser) light requires information on propagation of light in the skin related to the optical properties of the individual skin layers. This involves the solution of the integro-differential equation of radiative transfer in a model representing skin geometry, as well as experimental methods to determine the optical properties of each skin layer. These activities are unified under the name skin optics. This paper first reviews the current status of tissue optics, distinguishing between the cases of: dominant absorption, dominant scattering, and scattering about equal to absorption. Then, previously published data as well as some current unpublished data on (human) stratum corneum, epidermis and dermis, have been collected and/or (re)analyzed in terms of absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, and anisotropy factor of scattering. The results are that the individual skin layers show strongly forward scattering (anisotropy factors between 0.7 and 0.9). The absorption and scattering data show that for all wavelengths considered scattering is much more important than absorption. Under such circumstances, solutions to the transport equation for a multilayer skin model and finite beam laser irradiation are currently not yet available. Hence, any quantitative dosimetry for skin treated with (laser) light is currently lacking.},

abstract = {Determination of tissue optical properties is fundamental for application of light in either therapeutical or diagnostics procedures. In the present work we implemented a spatially resolved steady-state diffuse reflectance method where only two fibers (one source and one detector) spaced 2.5 mm apart are used for the determination of the optical properties. The method relies on the spectral characteristics of the tissue chromophores (water, dry tissue, and blood) and the assumption of a simple wavelength dependent expression for the determination of the reduced scattering coefficient. Because of the probe dimensions the method is suited for endoscopic measurements. The method was validated against more traditional models, such as the diffusion theory combined with adding doubling for in vitro measurements of bovine muscle. Mean and standard deviation of the absorption coefficient and the reduced scattering coefficient at 630 nm for normal mucosa were 0.87+/-0.22 cm(-1) and 7.8+/-2.3 cm(-1), respectively. Cancerous mucosa had values 1.87+/-1.10 cm(-1) and 8.4+/-2.3 cm(-1), respectively. These values are similar to data presented by other authors. Blood perfusion was the main variable accounting for differences in the absorption coefficient between the studied tissues.},

abstract = {Dermatology has quantified skin color for monitoring progress of treatments. The most common and effective means of erythema detection is visual inspection of the skin. However, for people with darkly pigmented skin, erythema can be masked by melanin. Tissue Reflectance Spectroscopy (TRS) is a noninvasive method of quantifying skin color. Most commonly, TRS quantifies erythema caused by cosmetics, topical ointments, UV light, or other irritants. Recently, TRS has been used to characterize the presence of erythema due to reactive hyperemia or Stage I pressure ulcers. The objective of this study was to compare the reliability and validity of erythema detection algorithms by determining their sensitivity and specificity. Two algorithms, Diffey and Helen Hayes Hospital (HHH), had sensitivity exceeding 85\% and specificity exceeding 75\%, but most algorithms demonstrated adequate validity across all subjects. The validity of the HHH algorithm did not change with the skin pigmentation of the subject. The results of this comparison will be useful to researchers interested in using TRS to detect erythema in people with different skin pigment levels.},

The change of the absorbance spectrum from reflectance including the scattering effect does not correspond to the molar absorption spectrum of melanin and blood. The modified Beer-Lambert law is applied to the change in the absorbance spectrum from reflectance of human skin as the change in melanin and blood is assumed to be small. The concentration of melanin and blood was estimated from the absorbance spectrum reflectance of human skin using multiple regression analysis.

For the specific reduced scattering coefficient, the values we have obtained, averaged over the nine batches, are 25.9, 21.2, and 18.4 mm(-1) at $\lambda$ = 632.8, 751, and 833 nm, respectively, and the corresponding maximum deviations from the average were 2.2\%, 1.1\%, and 1.4\%. For the absorption coefficient, we obtained values slightly smaller with respect to the absorption coefficient of pure water at 751 and 833 nm, and slightly larger at 632.8 nm.

@article{Bernards1999,
abstract = {Background: Local anesthetic nerve block prolonged by epinephrine is thought to result from local vasoconstriction and consequent decreased local anesthetic clearance from the injection site. However, no study has yet confirmed this directly in humans by measuring tissue concentrations of local anesthetic over time. In addition, recent studies have shown that the $\alpha$2‐adrenergic receptor agonist, clonidine, also prolongs nerve block without altering local anesthetic clearance. Because epinephrine is also an $\alpha$2‐adrenergic receptor agonist, it is possible that epinephrine prolongs local anesthetic block by a pharmacodynamic mechanism and not a pharmacokinetic one. This study was designed to address this issue. Methods: Microdialysis probes were placed adjacent to the superficial peroneal nerve in both feet of eight volunteers. Plain lidocaine (1\%) was injected along one peroneal nerve and lidocaine with epinephrine (2.5 $\mu$g/ml) was injected along the other nerve in a double‐blinded, randomized manner. The concentration of lidocaine in tissue was measured at 5‐min intervals, and sensory block and cutaneous blood flow were assessed by laser Doppler at 10‐min intervals for 5 h. The resulting data for lidocaine concentration versus time were fit to a two‐compartment model using modeling software. Results: Epinephrine prolonged sensory block by decreasing local blood flow and slowing clearance. There was no evidence of a pharmacodynamic effect of epinephrine. Conclusion: Although epinephrine activates $\alpha$2‐adrenergic receptors, its mechanism for prolonging the duration of local anesthetic block rests on its ability to decrease local anesthetic clearance and not on a pharmacodynamically mediated potentiation of local anesthetic effect.},

Similarly, DCS found significant changes in tumor/normal blood flow contrast (rBFT/N=75+/-7\% on day 7 with respect to day 0). Our observations suggest the combination of DCS and DOS enhances treatment monitoring compared to either technique alone. The hybrid approach also enables construction of indices reflecting tissue metabolic rate of oxygen, which may provide new insights about therapy mechanisms.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the techniques of measurement of reflectance and diffuse transmittance where it is associated with diffuse reflectance in a technique called “transflectance.” “Reflectance spectroscopy” concerns the measurement of four distinct types of materials and their interaction with light. Specular materials reflect the predominant amount of radiation at an angle equal and opposite to the incident radiation. Diffusely reflective materials scatter light over a wide range of angles with the perfectly diffuse (or Lambertian) scatterer exhibiting a cosine response to the incident radiation. Gonioapparent materials have both a specular and a diffuse component (as do most materials) but these substances have particular scattering components only at certain angles of incidence or collection because of particulate inclusions within the materials. The chapter discusses transflectance to cover those materials that both diffusely reflect and diffusely transmit incident radiation. Relative reflectance requires the use of a reference mirror to produce accurate measurements. Absolute specular measurements do not require a reference mirror but instead use various optical techniques to bring the reflected beam to a detector. Both of these measurements have their advantages and pitfalls that must be considered in choosing the measurement technique.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to propose a model and a method to derive the oxyhemoglobin blood content in the retinal veins and arteries by full spectrum reflectometry measurements in the spectral zone from 430 to 680 nm. We proposed a mathematical equation expressed as a linear combination of two terms S(OHb)($\lambda$) and S(Hb)($\lambda$) representing the normalized spectral absorption functions of the hemoglobin and the oxyhemoglobin, one term $\lambda$(-n) representing the ocular media absorption with scattering, and a family of multi-Gaussian functions, which usefully compensate for the noncompatibility of the model and the experimental data in the red spectral zone. The present paper suggests that the spectral reflection function in the area from 520 to 580 nm is optimal in calculating the oxyhemoglobin concentration of the blood contained in the endothelial structures of retinal vessels. The model calculation needs a function (1/$\lambda$)(-n) that corrects for the ocular media absorption and light scattering on the vessels' structures. For the spectral area of lights with wavelength larger than 580 nm, the reflected light represents mainly the light scattering on the red blood cells.},

Measurements show that reflectance spectra of the different lesions manifest dissimilar patterns, particularly in the near IR region. Comparison of reflectance of nevi with that of malignant melanomas results in a highly significant difference (P less than 10(-6)) between the two samples. Though interpretation of the spectra remains difficult as a result of the complexity of the optical processes of scattering and absorption, our results suggest that a detailed analysis of the reflectance spectrum may give clinically useful information, and could be utilized as an aid in clinical diagnosis of cutaneous pigmented lesions, especially where malignant melanoma is concerned.},

abstract = {Multispectral images of skin contain information on the spatial distribution of biological chromophores, such as blood and melanin. From this, parameters such as blood volume and blood oxygenation can be retrieved using reconstruction algorithms. Most such approaches use some form of pixelwise or volumetric reconstruction code. We explore the use of principal component analysis (PCA) of multispectral images to access blood volume and blood oxygenation in near real time. We present data from healthy volunteers under arterial occlusion of the forearm, experiencing ischemia and reactive hyperemia. Using a two-layered analytical skin model, we show reconstruction results of blood volume and oxygenation and compare it to the results obtained from our new spectral analysis based on PCA. We demonstrate that PCA applied to multispectral images gives near equivalent results for skin chromophore mapping and quantification with the advantage of being three orders of magnitude faster than the reconstruction algorithm.},

abstract = {We have discovered quantitative optical biomarkers unique to cancer by developing a double-differential spectroscopic analysis method for near-infrared (NIR, 650-1000 nm) spectra acquired non-invasively from breast tumors. These biomarkers are characterized by specific NIR absorption bands. The double-differential method removes patient specific variations in molecular composition which are not related to cancer, and reveals these specific cancer biomarkers. Based on the spectral regions of absorption, we identify these biomarkers with lipids that are present in tumors either in different abundance than in the normal breast or new lipid components that are generated by tumor metabolism. Furthermore, the O-H overtone regions (980-1000 nm) show distinct variations in the tumor as compared to the normal breast. To quantify spectral variation in the absorption bands, we constructed the Specific Tumor Component (STC) index. In a pilot study of 12 cancer patients we found 100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity for lesion identification. The STC index, combined with other previously described tissue optical indices, further improves the diagnostic power of NIR for breast cancer detection.},

Previously reported scaling problems are avoided by storing detection events individually, turning spatial and temporal binning into post-simulation activities. The approach is suitable for modeling of both interstitial and noninvasive settings (i.e., infinite and semi-infinite geometries). Motivated by an interest in in vivo optical properties of human prostate tissue, we utilize WMC to explore the low albedo regime of time-domain photon migration--a regime where the diffusion approximation of radiative transport theory breaks down, leading to the risk of overestimating both reduced scattering (mu(s)') and absorption (mu(a)). Experimental work supports our findings and establishes the advantages of Monte Carlo-based evaluation.},

Four parameters were obtained: hemoglobin concentration, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, effective scatterer density, and effective scatterer size. Normal and adenomatous tissue sites exhibited differences in hemoglobin concentration and, on average, in effective scatterer size, which were in general agreement with other studies that employ standard methods. These results suggest that diffuse reflectance can be used to obtain tissue information about tissue structure and composition in vivo.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Nosocomial infections affect up to 26\% of ICU patients. Compliance with the required hand hygiene procedures remains low, rarely exceeding 50\%, with skin irritation as one of the main reasons for lack of conformity. The aim was to quantify the epidermal barrier effects, particularly erythema, from repetitive exposure to hand hygiene procedures among health care workers (HCWs) using an objective, reliable clinical method that could evaluate the entire hand surface. METHODS: The hand skin of HCWs was evaluated before the initial scrub and at the end of multiple 2-3 days work cycles during spring (n=54) and winter (n=60) trials. The skin condition was measured with live visual skin evaluation (LSG), digital image analysis (DIA) of high-resolution digital images, and visual perception evaluation (VPS) of image pairs. RESULTS: The HCWs had significantly higher values of erythema than the non-HCW control group with all methods. Knuckle erythema increased over the cycle in both seasons. It decreased during recovery in spring and continued to increase during recovery in winter. For the DIA area of excess redness, the quantitative measure of erythema, the decrease over the cycle in spring was significantly different than the increase over the cycle in winter. Minimal changes in area of excess redness occurred during recovery in both seasons. With the VPS, both judges found a decrease in erythema during recovery in spring and an increase during recovery in winter, indicating significant differences for spring vs. winter (P<0.05). No differences in VPS erythema were seen for either product set over the work cycle during spring. Correlations were observed for (1) results for the VPS vs. the LSG method and (2) between excess erythema (mu+sigma) from DIA and the VPS erythema scores. Relatively low correlations were found between the DIA and VPS methods, i.e., knuckle mu+sigma and VPS erythema. CONCLUSIONS: Significant work cycle effects for spring vs. winter were observed with DIA, while significant effects were found during the recovery period with VPS. DIA produced an objective quantitative measure of erythema that was not limited or influenced by other aspects of skin irritation (e.g., dryness, scaling) or texture encountered in the visual methods of LSG and VPS. The DIA method minimizes the difficulty in differentiating erythema severity. Standardization of image capture and processing allows assessment of skin condition across clinical locations. The VPS is a more reliable way to compare skin condition at different times, i.e. beginning vs. the end of a treatment cycle, because images are viewed simultaneously and can be carefully examined for differences.},

In addition to quantification of haemoglobin and melanin, qualitative information on the redox state of the blood may also be obtained. Measurements made on a port wine stain, which had been treated with 576 nm CW laser radiation at times between 1 and 6 months previously, provided information on the vascular response to this thermal injury. Despite the treated area visually appearing normal at 6 months post-treatment the measured levels of deoxygenated and total haemoglobin were still markedly higher than those in the adjacent uninvolved skin.

abstract = {The purpose of the study was to compare algorithms of four methods (plus two modifications) for spectrophotometric haemoglobin saturation measurements. Comparison was made in tissue phantoms basically consisting of a phosphate buffer, Intralipid and blood, allowing samples to be taken for reference measurements. Three experimental series were made. In experiment A (eight phantoms) we used the Knoefel method and measured specific extinction coefficients with a reflection spectrophotometer. In experiment B (six phantoms) the fully oxygenated phantoms were gradually deoxygenated with baker's yeast, and simultaneous measurements were made with our spectrophotometer and with a reference oxymeter (ABL-605) in 3 min intervals. For each spectrophotometric measurement haemoglobin saturation was calculated with all algorithms and modifications, and compared with reference. In experiment C (11 phantoms) we evaluated the ability of a modification of the Knoefel method to measure haemoglobin concentration in absolute quantities using extinction coefficients from experiment A.Results. Experiment A: with the Knoefel method extinction coefficients (+/-SD) for oxyhaemoglobin at 553.04 and 573.75 nm were 1.117 (+/-0.0396) ODmM(-1) and 1.680 (+/- 0.0815) ODmM(-1), respectively, and for deoxyhaemoglobin 1.205 (+/- 0.0514) ODmM(-1) and 0.953 (+/-0.0487) ODmM(-1), respectively. Experiment B: high correlation with the reference was found in all methods (r = 0.94-0.97). However, agreement varied from evidently wrong in method 3 and the original method 4 (e.g. saturation above 160\%) to high agreement in method 2 as well as the modifications of methods 1 and 4, where oxygen dissociation curves were close to the reference method. Experiment C: with the modified Knoefel method the mean haemoglobin concentration difference from reference was 8.3\% and the correlation was high (r = 0.91). We conclude that method 2 and the modifications of 1 and 4 were superior to the others, but depended on known values in the same or similar phantoms. The original method 1 was independent of results from the tissue phantoms, but agreement was slightly poorer. Method 3 and the original method 4 could not be recommended. The ability of the modified method 1 to measure haemoglobin concentration is promising, but needs further development.},

The technique utilizes multiple regression analysis aided by Monte Carlo simulation for diffuse reflectance spectra. Using the absorbance spectrum as a response variable and the extinction coefficients of melanin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin as predictor variables, multiple regression analysis provides regression coefficients. Concentrations of melanin and total blood are then determined from the regression coefficients using conversion vectors that are deduced numerically in advance, while oxygen saturation is obtained directly from the regression coefficients. Experiments with a tissue-like agar gel phantom validated the method. In vivo experiments with human skin of the human hand during upper limb occlusion and of the inner forearm exposed to UV irradiation demonstrated the ability of the method to evaluate physiological reactions of human skin tissue.},

abstract = {Monitoring the onset of erythema following external beam radiation therapy has the potential to offer a means of managing skin toxicities via biological targeted agents - prior to full progression. However, current skin toxicity scoring systems are subjective and provide at best a qualitative evaluation. Here, we investigate the potential of diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) to provide quantitative metrics for scoring skin toxicity. A DOS fiberoptic reflectance probe was used to collect white light spectra at two probing depths using two short fixed source-collector pairs with optical probing depths sensitive to the skin surface. The acquired spectra were fit to a diffusion theory model of light transport in tissue to extract optical biomarkers (hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, scattering power and slope) from superficial skin layers of nude mice, which were subjected to erythema inducing doses of ionizing radiation. A statistically significant increase in oxygenated hemoglobin (p < 0.0016) was found in the skin post-irradiation - confirming previous reports. More interesting, we observed for the first time that the spectral scattering parameters, A (p = 0.026) and k (p = 0.011), were an indicator of erythema at day 6 and could potentially serve as an early detection optical biomarker of skin toxicity. Our data suggests that reflectance DOS may be employed to provide quantitative assessment of skin toxicities following curative doses of external beam radiation.},

In this work, a general treatment of the problem of diffuse reflectance from a homogeneous semi-infinite turbid medium is presented using Monte Carlo simulations. Based on the results of the Monte Carlo method, simple semi-empirical analytical solutions are developed valid for a wide range of collection geometries corresponding to various optical detector diameters. This approach may be useful for the quick and accurate modeling of diffuse reflectance from tissues.},

The weekly rBF, StO(2), and THC kinetics exhibit different patterns for different individuals, including significant early blood flow changes during the first two weeks. Averaged blood flow increases (52.7+/-9.7)\% in the first week and decreases (42.4+/-7.0)\% in the second week. Averaged StO(2) increases from (62.9+/-3.4)\% baseline value to (70.4+/-3.2)\% at the end of the second week, and averaged THC exhibits a continuous decrease from pretreatment value of (80.7+/-7.0) [microM] to (73.3+/-8.3) [microM] at the end of the second week and to (63.0+/-8.1) [microM] at the end of the fourth week of therapy.

This technology is based on differences of endogenous chromophores between cancer and normal tissues using either oxy-haemoglobin or deoxy-haemoglobin, lipid or water bands, or a combination of two or more of these as diagnostic markers. These marker bands provide a basis for the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of several cancers. Various applications also use advances in NIR fluorescence spectroscopy which is based on exogenous contrast-enhancing agents. In this review the literature published during the last seven years has been assessed. It will provide an overview on the importance of the NIRS tools in cancer pathology, and in the near future it is envisaged to play a crucial role in cancer diagnosis, treatment decisions, and defining therapeutic drug levels.},

abstract = {Studies examining acute oxygenation and perfusion changes in irradiated skin are limited. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI), a method of wide-field, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, provides noninvasive, quantified measurements of cutaneous oxygenation and perfusion. This study examines whether HSI can assess acute changes in oxygenation and perfusion following irradiation. Skin on both flanks of nude mice (n=20) was exposed to 50 Gy of beta radiation from a strontium-90 source. Hyperspectral images were obtained before irradiation and on selected days for three weeks. Skin reaction assessment was performed concurrently with HSI. Desquamative injury formed in all irradiated areas. Skin reactions were first seen on day 7, with peak formation on day 14, and resolution beginning by day 21. HSI demonstrated increased tissue oxygenation on day 1 before cutaneous changes were observed (p<0.001). Further increases over baseline were seen on day 14, but returned to baseline levels by day 21. For perfusion, similar increases were seen on days 1 and 14. Unlike tissue oxygenation, perfusion was decreased below baseline on day 21 (p<0.002). HSI allows for complete visualization and quantification of tissue oxygenation and perfusion changes in irradiated skin, and may also allow prediction of acute skin reactions based on early changes seen after irradiation.},

This device has been constructed and used to compare with visual assessments of ultraviolet radiation in human subjects. A statistically significant correlation was obtained between erythema index and visual assessment in 24 ultraviolet irradiated subjects. Furthermore, the effects of three aftersun treatments have also been assessed objectively using the meter and subjectively using visual assessments. The ultraviolet-irradiated areas were less red following treatment than the irradiated and untreated areas. The results obtained by the meter were similar to and statistically significant with those obtained by visual assessment. It is concluded that widespread use of an erythema meter such as that described would greatly improve all cutaneous erythema assessments.},

abstract = {Both in medical research and clinical settings, regional hemoglobin concentrations ([Hb]) in the microcirculation of biological tissues are highly sought. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy has been proven to be a favorable method by which to detect regional [Hb]. This paper introduces a new algorithm to retrieve [Hb] information from diffuse reflectance spectra. The proposed algorithm utilizes the natural logarithmic operation and the differential wavelet transform to effectively quench the scattering effects, and then employs the concept of isosbestic wavelength in the transformed spectra to reduce the effects of hemoglobin oxygenation. As a result, the intensity at the defined isosbestic wavelength of the transformed spectra is a good indicator of [Hb] estimation. The algorithm was derived and validated using theoretical spectra produced by Monte Carlo simulation of photon migration. Its accuracy was further evaluated using liquid tissue phantoms, and its clinical utility with an in vivo clinical study of brain tumors. The results demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm for real-time [Hb] estimations from diffuse reflectance spectra, acquired by means of a fiber-optic spectroscopy system.},

The purpose of this pilot study was to determine whether measurement of spectral difference in absorbance (SDA) between various skin lesions and normal skin adjacent to them could yield useful information for clinics in dermatology.

METHODS: We studied spectral reflectance of a total of 173 various skin lesions. After converting obtained reflectance into apparent absorbance A (=log(10)(1/reflectance)), we examined the profile of SDA, that is, A(lesion)-A(normal skin) in the range of 400-700 nm, and compared them with the absorbance spectra of melanin and hemoglobin.

RESULTS: SDA of epidermal pigmentary disorders was similar to the absorption spectrum of melanin in vitro, but the cases with intradermal melanin deposition showed a different pattern, reflecting the scattering effect of the dermis. SDA of erythematous lesions was similar to the spectra of either oxygenated or reduced hemoglobin, and varied according to the oxygenated level of cutaneous blood. SDA of lesions with a combination of factors appeared as a simple summation of spectra corresponding to each of the factors.

CONCLUSIONS: Our method may offer easy and quick detection of major pathophysiological changes in skin lesions.},

This device coupled with an inverse Monte Carlo model of reflectance is demonstrated to accurately quantify tissue absorption and scattering in tissue-like turbid synthetic phantoms with a wide range of optical properties. The overall errors for quantifying the absorption and scattering coefficients are 6.0+/-5.6 and 6.1+/-4.7\%, respectively. Compared with fiber-based detection, having the detector right at the tissue surface can significantly improve light collection efficiency, thus reducing the requirement for sophisticated detectors with high sensitivity, and this design can be easily expanded into a quantitative spectral imaging system for mapping tissue optical properties in vivo.},

abstract = {Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a noninvasive optical technique that is increasingly used to assess muscle oxygenation during exercise with the assumption that the contribution of skin blood flow to the NIR signal is minor or nonexistent. We tested this assumption in humans by monitoring forearm tissue oxygenation during selective cutaneous vasodilation induced by locally applied heat (n = 6) or indirect whole body heating (i.e., heating subject but not area surrounding NIR probes; n = 8). Neither perturbation has been shown to cause a measurable change in muscle blood flow or metabolism. Local heating (approximately 41 degrees C) caused large increases in the NIR-derived tissue oxygenation signal [before heating = 0.82 +/- 0.89 optical density (OD), after heating = 18.21 +/- 2.44 OD; P < 0.001]. Similarly, whole body heating (increase internal temperature 0.9 degrees C) also caused large increases in the tissue oxygenation signal (before heating = -0.31 +/- 1.47 OD, after heating = 12.48 +/- 1.82 OD; P < 0.001). These increases in the tissue oxygenation signal were closely correlated with increases in skin blood flow during both local heating (mean r = 0.95 +/- 0.02) and whole body heating (mean r = 0.89 +/- 0.04). These data suggest that the contribution of skin blood flow to NIR measurements of tissue oxygenation can be significant, potentially confounding interpretation of the NIR-derived signal during conditions where both skin and muscle blood flows are elevated concomitantly (e.g., high-intensity and/or prolonged exercise).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Dermal water plays an important role in the physical properties of the skin. Recently, researchers have attempted to directly measure the dermal water content in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging, near infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. However, these methods have limitations. Although confocal Raman spectroscopy has been developed to measure the water content in the skin, no reports have suggested that this instrument can measure the dermal water content. This report describes a method for measuring the dermal water content in vivo using confocal Raman spectroscopy.

METHODS: We used a confocal Raman spectrometer and adjusted the laser exposure time and depth increments according to the skin depth. Age-related changes in the dermal water content of the forearm were examined in 30 young and 30 elderly male subjects. Diurnal changes in the dermal water content of the forearm were examined in 12 elderly male subjects.

RESULTS: Adjusting the exposure time and depth increment dramatically improved the signal-to-noise ratios of the Raman spectra. Elderly dermis had significantly higher water content than young dermis. Moreover, the dermal water content displayed a diurnal change.

CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the dermal water content can be measured in vivo using confocal Raman spectroscopy.},

abstract = {A multi-spectral diffuse reflectance imaging method based on a single snap shot of Red-Green-Blue images acquired with the exposure time of 65 ms (15 fps) was investigated for estimating melanin concentration, blood concentration, and oxygen saturation in human skin tissue. The technique utilizes the Wiener estimation method to deduce spectral reflectance images instantaneously from an RGB image. Using the resultant absorbance spectrum as a response variable and the extinction coefficients of melanin, oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin as predictor variables, multiple regression analysis provides regression coefficients. Concentrations of melanin and total blood are then determined from the regression coefficients using conversion vectors that are numerically deduced in advance by the Monte Carlo simulations for light transport in skin. Oxygen saturation is obtained directly from the regression coefficients. Experiments with a tissue-like agar gel phantom validated the method. In vivo experiments on fingers during upper limb occlusion demonstrated the ability of the method to evaluate physiological reactions of human skin.},

The instrument incorporates a tungsten halogen lamp light source, light transmission by fibre optics and wavelength selection by a circular variable wavelength interference filter. A microcomputer controls the instrument and processes the data. The performance of the instrument was evaluated by undertaking in vitro measurements of the reflectance spectra of blood. An index of the haemoglobin content of the sample based on the gradients of the log inverse reflectance spectrum between isobestic points at 527.5, 544 and 573 nm was devised and shown to be independent of the oxygenation of the haemoglobin. The haemoglobin index was combined with measurements at 558.5 nm, a wavelength at which absorbance is sensitive to the oxygenation of haemoglobin, to give a measure of oxygen saturation. The parameter was validated by determining the oxygen dissociation curve of red cells in plasma in vitro at pH 7.33, 37 degrees C and under a partial pressure of 40 mmHg of CO2.},

Significant systematic errors can arise in the measured reflectance spectra and thus in the derived tissue physiological and morphological parameters due to real-time instrument fluctuations. We demonstrate a novel fiber optic probe with real-time, self-calibration capability that can be used for UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in biological tissue in clinical settings. The probe is tested in a number of synthetic liquid phantoms over a wide range of tissue optical properties for significant variations in source intensity fluctuations caused by instrument warm up and day-to-day drift. While the accuracy for extraction of absorber concentrations is comparable to that achieved with the traditional calibration (with a reflectance standard), the accuracy for extraction of reduced scattering coefficients is significantly improved with the self-calibration probe compared to traditional calibration. This technology could be used to achieve instrument-independent diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in vivo and obviate the need for instrument warm up and post∕premeasurement calibration, thus saving up to an hour of precious clinical time.},

abstract = {Radiation skin reactions occur in the majority of cases of patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer with varying degrees of severity. Guidelines for skin care and for the use of topical agents and dressings have developed over the years of practice but there is little empirical evidence on which to base a decision for best practice. This paper describes the incidence of radiation skin reactions in a sample of 126 women treated for breast cancer post-lumpectomy. The results show that by the end of whole breast irradiation between 4-8\% of patients will have no reaction and less than 10\% will have moist desquamation as measured by the RTOG acute scoring system. The majority of patients did not require application of a topical agent during the treatment period. Statistical analysis of relationships between the severity of radiation skin reaction and the use of topical agents found no support for additional healing or preventative benefit. However, these topical agents were found to promote comfort. The use of Fixomull as a protector and potential preventive measure for moist desquamation is described.},

Conventional measurement of the intensity of blanching relies on subjective assessment by a trained observer using a visual score. Several objective techniques have recently been reported to detect skin blanching, but their sensitivity has not been compared previously with subjective visual recordings. In this report we aimed to establish whether objective methods offer sufficient sensitivity to be employed in epidemiological studies of glucocorticoid responsiveness. In healthy subjects we applied beclomethasone dipropionate at three concentrations (1, 10 and 100 micrograms/ml) under an occluded dressing overnight. The following morning we measured blanching using a visual score, laser Doppler velocimetry with the MBF 3D monitor (Moor Instruments Ltd, U.K.) and a perfusion imager (Lisca, Sweden), and reflectance spectrophotometry with the Dia-Stron 'erythemameter'. Using the visual score, blanching was detected at all concentrations of steroid. Neither laser Doppler instrument detected vasoconstriction at any concentration. By contrast, the reflectance spectrophotometer successfully recorded blanching at 10 and 100 micrograms/ml, but not at 1 microgram/ml. We conclude that laser Doppler instruments, including the novel scanning perfusion imager, do not detect glucocorticoid-induced skin blanching, perhaps because it reflects venular rather than arteriolar vasoconstriction. By contrast, the Dia-Stron reflectance spectrophotometer has sufficient sensitivity to be used as an alternative to visual assessment in epidemiological studies of human glucocorticoid-induced dermal blanching.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current evaluation of radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer relies on subjective scoring with interrater variability. We evaluated serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) as objective markers of radiation-induced mucositis.

METHODS: Weekly serum CRP and ESR levels were measured in patients treated for head and neck cancer with radiation ± chemotherapy. Acute radiation toxicity was evaluated using National Cancer Institute of Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCIC-CTC) version 2.0 and the Head and Neck Radiotherapy Questionnaire (HNRQ).

RESULTS: ESR and CRP levels were significantly elevated by 3 weeks (p = .01) and 6 weeks (p = .0002), respectively, and independent of age or pretreatment surgery. ESR was significantly dependent on radiation dose (p = .0004) and significantly higher with chemoradiation (p = .03).

CONCLUSION: Serum ESR and CRP rise reliably in a radiation dose-dependent manner. ESR correlated with clinical symptoms and distinguished patients receiving chemoradiation. ESR and CRP may be an objective and sensitive marker of radiation-induced mucositis.},

abstract = {A simple method to evaluate the hemoglobin oxygen saturation and relative hemoglobin concentration in a tissue from diffuse reflectance spectra in the visible wavelength range is put forward in this paper. It was assumed that while oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin contributions to light attenuation are strongly variable functions of wavelength, all other contributions to the attenuation including scattering are smooth wavelength functions and can be approximated by Taylor series expansion. Based on this assumption, a simple, robust algorithm suitable for real time monitoring of the hemoglobin oxygen saturation in the tissue has been derived. This algorithm can be used with different fiber probe configurations for delivering and collecting light passed through the tissue. An experimental technique using this algorithm has been developed for in vivo monitoring during artery occlusion and in vitro monitoring of blood samples. The experimental results obtained are presented in the paper.},

@article{Enfield2009,
abstract = {Diffuse optical imaging and spectroscopy use near-infrared light to derive physiological parameters such as total hemoglobin concentration and tissue oxygen saturation. Numerous clinical studies have been carried out, either using stand-alone optical methods or in combination with alternative imaging techniques. Studies have demonstrated that diffuse optical imaging and spectroscopy are able to distinguish malignant lesions from benign tissues. Breast cancer is characterized by an increase in total hemoglobin and a decrease in tissue oxygen saturation. Benign lesions such as cysts and fibroadenomas have also been studied, with less conclusive results. As diffuse optical imaging and spectroscopy do not use ionizing radiation, they are a suitable technique for performing repeated scans, such as for monitoring treatment response. This provides a unique functional and dynamic imaging method that reflects changes in tumor angiogenesis and hypoxia. When breast cancers are treated with primary medical therapy, this can result in a selective antiangiogenic effect that could help predict response to treatment earlier than by assessment of tumor size. Diffuse optical imaging and spectroscopy have been used to scan women at several points prior to and during their neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment, with images and data showing physiological changes in the tumor in response to treatment. In the women who respond to therapy, the total hemoglobin concentration decreases and the level of oxygenation increases in the tumor over the course of the treatment. It is possible to predict a response to treatment as little as 4 days after the start of treatment. These findings demonstrate that optical techniques could play a role in the monitoring of changes in angiogenesis, apoptosis and hypoxia due to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The erythema resulting from the minimal erythema dose (MED) test is subjectively assessed. The evaluator visually grades erythema on an ordinal scale. Both intra- and interobserver variation have been found for this erythema assessment. We wanted to examine if objective measurements could be used to confirm the subjective finding. METHODS: One hundred two ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-exposed skin sites on the backs of 17 healthy volunteers were assessed. Erythema was visually graded according to a 5-point scale [0, (+), 1+, 2+, 3+] and objectively measured by a skin reflectance meter. Skin water content was objectively measured by tissue dielectric constant measurements. RESULTS: The relationship between subjective assessments and objective measurements of erythema was found to be linear (R(2) = 0.482, P < 0.0001). A positive correlation was found between subjective assessments of erythema and objective measurements of water content (Spearman's Rho = 0.414, P < 0.0001). Water content in categories 2+ and 3+ of the subjective erythema assessments differed significantly from the lesser categories (P < 0.0001). A linear relationship was found between the objective measurements of erythema and water content (R(2) = 0.241, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Objective measurements of skin erythema and water content after UV exposure were in good agreement with the subjective assessments of erythema, but showed considerable interpersonal variation.},

abstract = {Differences in absorption and/or scattering of cancerous and normal skin have the potential to provide a basis for noninvasive cancer detection. In this study, we have determined and compared the in vitro optical properties of human epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous fat with those of nonmelanoma skin cancers in the spectral range from 370 to 1600 nm. Fresh specimens of normal and cancerous human skin were obtained from surgeries. The samples were rinsed in saline solution and sectioned. Diffuse reflectance and total transmittance were measured using an integrating sphere spectrophotometer. Absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were calculated from the measured quantities using an inverse Monte Carlo technique. The differences between optical properties of each normal tissue-cancer pair were statistically analyzed. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the scattering of cancerous and healthy tissues in the spectral range from 1050 to 1400 nm. In this spectral region, the scattering of cancerous lesions is consistently lower than that of normal tissues, whereas absorption does not differ significantly, with the exception of nodular basal cell carcinomas (BCC). Nodular BCCs exhibit significantly lower absorption as compared to normal skin. Therefore, the spectral range between 1050 and 1400 nm appears to be optimal for nonmelanoma skin cancer detection.},
