\section{Summary \& Thesis Conclusions}
Stuff.

\section{Future Work}
system and model can be adapted for : monitoring other tissue chromophores such as bilirubin and beta carotene, application in determining the age of bruises, jaundice
Adapt to other tissues other than skin? Brain? far infrared?

More indepth study required, comparing visual assessment to system/model

Question regarding the minimum increase required for visual detection, could be achieved with lidocaine injections of varying concentrations
More work with darker skinned individuals (IMRT study only had Caucasian males), test across Fitzpatrick scale

Find correlation between skin redness corrected for dose and radiosensitivity (DNA expression) (need a larger/broader sample size)

Automated interface, matlab gui

Use a similar reflectance standard to skin instead of 99\% to avoid SLCF and SBSE?
